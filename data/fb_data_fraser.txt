Oct 20, 2019, 10:40 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Thanks for the help bro xx
Oct 20, 2019, 10:40 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'll work it out
Oct 20, 2019, 10:40 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah good call
Oct 20, 2019, 10:40 PM
George Hughes
I don't really know what else to suggest, sorry. Maybe ask in a music store?
Oct 20, 2019, 5:22 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's fair, computers can be a hassle when you just want to make music
Oct 20, 2019, 5:21 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Cba using my computer
Oct 20, 2019, 5:14 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Honestly tho
Oct 20, 2019, 5:14 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Cheers dude x
Oct 20, 2019, 5:13 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But that might work...
Oct 20, 2019, 5:13 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I've got a couple of mics
Oct 20, 2019, 5:13 PM
George Hughes
And microphone
Oct 20, 2019, 4:32 PM
George Hughes
Plus cheap midi keyboard with USB cable
Oct 20, 2019, 4:31 PM
George Hughes
TAL vocoder VST plugin
Oct 20, 2019, 4:31 PM
George Hughes
This or something like if

Oct 20, 2019, 4:31 PM
George Hughes
Here's an idea
Oct 20, 2019, 4:30 PM
George Hughes
What processor does your computer have?
Oct 20, 2019, 4:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nopeeee
Oct 20, 2019, 4:22 PM
George Hughes
Have you got a mac?
Oct 20, 2019, 4:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah it's not ideal
Oct 20, 2019, 4:21 PM
George Hughes
Ahh, if it's too shit for garageband, any music app you download will have awful latency issues
Oct 20, 2019, 4:20 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Too shit for garageband
Oct 20, 2019, 4:20 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah but it's a shit ipad
Oct 20, 2019, 4:20 PM
George Hughes
Cause android won't be able to do something like that effectively
Oct 20, 2019, 4:19 PM
George Hughes
I can't actually remember, do you have an apple device?
Oct 20, 2019, 4:19 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Oh called what?
Oct 20, 2019, 4:19 PM
George Hughes
Ohh that was a separate app
Oct 20, 2019, 4:18 PM
Fraser Macdonald
You showed it to me! On the trip from derry
Oct 20, 2019, 4:18 PM
George Hughes
That's pretty cool!
Oct 20, 2019, 4:18 PM
George Hughes
I didn't realise the ipad version could do that
Oct 20, 2019, 4:18 PM
George Hughes
Quite fair
Oct 20, 2019, 4:18 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah i dont have it, and its the iPad version. And im not using garage band for classical composition it's trash
üòÜGeorge Hughes
Oct 20, 2019, 4:17 PM
George Hughes
Just use garageband for your composition then
Oct 20, 2019, 4:17 PM
George Hughes
The computer version?
Oct 20, 2019, 4:16 PM
George Hughes
On garageband?
Oct 20, 2019, 4:16 PM
Fraser Macdonald
So I don't see why it should cost 400
Oct 20, 2019, 4:13 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Cause I know u can sing into garage band, and it can harmonise what u sung live
Oct 20, 2019, 4:13 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Or just getting a keyboard that does a good human voice sound
Oct 20, 2019, 4:13 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah true
Oct 20, 2019, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
I'll have a think, maybe shelling out on a physical vocoder would be best
Oct 19, 2019, 7:54 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Then*
Oct 19, 2019, 7:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hm I'm not sure what to do the
Oct 19, 2019, 7:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Ahh
Oct 19, 2019, 7:22 PM
George Hughes
I guess the problem is that there's a learning curve for them
Oct 19, 2019, 7:13 PM
George Hughes
Hmm there are free daws out there that support plugins
Oct 19, 2019, 7:13 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah :(
Oct 19, 2019, 7:12 PM
George Hughes
That version doesn't support plugins
Oct 19, 2019, 7:11 PM
Fraser Macdonald
A basic version but yeag
Oct 19, 2019, 7:09 PM
George Hughes
Is that a version of it?
Oct 19, 2019, 7:09 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Pro tools first
Oct 19, 2019, 7:09 PM
George Hughes
You've got pro tools??
Oct 19, 2019, 7:08 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I've got pro tools first :) thanks man, chat later xx
Oct 19, 2019, 5:10 PM
George Hughes
Gtg
Oct 19, 2019, 5:10 PM
George Hughes
Like cubase or pro tools
Oct 19, 2019, 5:10 PM
George Hughes
Digital audio workstation
Oct 19, 2019, 5:10 PM
Fraser Macdonald
What's that?
Oct 19, 2019, 5:09 PM
George Hughes
You'd probably need a daw too
Oct 19, 2019, 5:09 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That will do minimum 10 notes
Oct 19, 2019, 5:04 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Oooh if I have a mic and a keyboard can I get a software one?
Oct 19, 2019, 5:04 PM
George Hughes
Honestly computers are the way to go when it comes to music making üíÅüèº
Oct 19, 2019, 5:02 PM
George Hughes
You'd need to buy a cheapy midi keyboard to plug into it though
Oct 19, 2019, 5:01 PM
George Hughes
Check out the Roland vt4 as well
Oct 19, 2019, 5:01 PM
George Hughes
It can only do four notes at once
Oct 19, 2019, 5:00 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And that would be sick x
Oct 19, 2019, 5:00 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I've tried your right?
Oct 19, 2019, 5:00 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah i need chords with like 5 voices, but they don't need to be polyphojc
Oct 19, 2019, 4:59 PM
George Hughes
Come try my one and see if it suits your needs
Oct 19, 2019, 4:59 PM
George Hughes
As long as you don't need more than four voices
Oct 19, 2019, 4:57 PM
George Hughes
I mean yeah I suppose you could
Oct 19, 2019, 4:56 PM
Fraser Macdonald
So could I not just sit down and work out chords, sing the vowels I wanted and write it down?
Oct 19, 2019, 4:55 PM
George Hughes
It's got four voice polyphony
Oct 19, 2019, 4:54 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That makes sense. I dont really
Oct 19, 2019, 4:54 PM
George Hughes
I mean by all means it's great if you want to do that too
Oct 19, 2019, 4:54 PM
George Hughes
It's more a tool for music producers who want to learn how to engineer sound is the thing
Oct 19, 2019, 4:53 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah pretty much, and i dont mind about 3 octaves cause it's for voices
Oct 19, 2019, 4:53 PM
George Hughes
And more octaves
Oct 19, 2019, 4:52 PM
George Hughes
The micro korg has three octaves of C and it's very technical. I assume what you want is more plug and play
Oct 19, 2019, 4:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
What was wrong with the micro korg?
Oct 19, 2019, 4:51 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But the vocoder would let me hear the vowels on the chord too
Oct 19, 2019, 4:51 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Like I can make chords on a piano
Oct 19, 2019, 4:51 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Cause u can just bundle on a piano
Oct 19, 2019, 4:51 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah but he said it forces u to voice lead
Oct 19, 2019, 4:51 PM
George Hughes
Most people would rather engineer the sound
Oct 19, 2019, 4:51 PM
George Hughes
So it's perfect for him
Oct 19, 2019, 4:50 PM
George Hughes
Collier can play the notes in his head without thinking twice
Oct 19, 2019, 4:50 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah but collier said it massively changed the way he wrote music
Oct 19, 2019, 4:50 PM
George Hughes
Generally not a useful tool, more of a gimmick, so most people just buy a virtual one for their daw
Oct 19, 2019, 4:49 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah fair, thanks for the advice bro x
Oct 19, 2019, 4:49 PM
George Hughes
Possibly because it's not a highly demanded product
Oct 19, 2019, 4:49 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Seems strange why it's so expensive
Oct 19, 2019, 4:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's okay I could ask them to pay half
Oct 19, 2019, 4:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'd rather just have a legit vocoder
Oct 19, 2019, 4:47 PM
George Hughes
Behringer have one which seems to be exactly what you're looking for, but it's above ¬£400
Oct 19, 2019, 4:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Cheers bro :)
Oct 19, 2019, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
Ah okay, I've had a look around and there's a couple ideas
Oct 19, 2019, 4:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Gonna ask for it for christmas
Oct 19, 2019, 4:45 PM
Fraser Macdonald
No clue
Oct 19, 2019, 4:45 PM
George Hughes
What's your budget?
Oct 19, 2019, 4:33 PM
George Hughes
Then the vocoder could be controlled by midi
Oct 19, 2019, 4:30 PM
George Hughes
What you could do is get a shitty midi keyboard and find a vocoder unit
Oct 19, 2019, 4:30 PM
George Hughes
You're gonna be looking at a fairly high price for something like that
Oct 19, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And maybe a strings setting
Oct 19, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And has a vocoder setting
Oct 19, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Only needs to be 3 ish octaves
Oct 19, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
For my compositions
Oct 19, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That would let me do harmony
Oct 19, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
A shitty keyboard
Oct 19, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
So basically
Oct 19, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
No clue lol
Oct 19, 2019, 4:28 PM
George Hughes
Are you thinking something like the microkorg?
Oct 19, 2019, 4:27 PM
George Hughes
Whatchu mean function as a piano?
Oct 19, 2019, 4:26 PM
George Hughes
That's true, it would I suppose
Oct 19, 2019, 4:26 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Just a bad one
Oct 19, 2019, 4:26 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And it would function as a normal piano too?
Oct 19, 2019, 4:26 PM
Fraser Macdonald
but it would give me a better idea of how the harmony worked with voices right?
Oct 19, 2019, 4:26 PM
George Hughes
Oh that's an interesting idea, vocoders tend not to sound very natural so it might not give you a great idea of a piece would sound like
Oct 19, 2019, 4:25 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Would u recommend one, just a basic type thing that doesn't need any extra kit yanno
Oct 19, 2019, 4:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But only to help with composition, so I can hear harmony and words yanno
Oct 19, 2019, 4:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'm looking to get a vocoder
Oct 19, 2019, 4:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Bro
Oct 19, 2019, 4:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Fair :)
Oct 19, 2019, 4:22 PM

Fraser Macdonald
I'll ask around, I could try and book the Holland piano, but it's usually super busy
Oct 11, 2019, 5:02 PM
George Hughes
Oh shit I gotcha, um do you know anywhere else with a piano? My uni has one if need be
Oct 11, 2019, 2:54 PM
Fraser Macdonald
There aren't any that's what I'm saying
Oct 11, 2019, 2:44 PM
George Hughes
Anyhow what are the ones at potterrow like?
Oct 11, 2019, 1:28 PM
George Hughes
Must have been moved then üíÅüèº

Oct 11, 2019, 12:50 PM
George Hughes
It might have been an electric grand come to think of it
Oct 11, 2019, 12:50 PM
George Hughes
Huh, there was one on the stage in one of the common rooms upstairs
Oct 11, 2019, 12:50 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Oct 11, 2019, 12:48 PM

Oct 11, 2019, 12:47 PM
George Hughes

Oct 11, 2019, 12:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Fraser Macdonald
I'm going to go ask in teviot house now
Oct 11, 2019, 12:43 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah thats ideal
Oct 11, 2019, 12:43 PM
George Hughes
Every second week would suit me best if that's okay
Oct 11, 2019, 12:42 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Would u want it every week or every 2nd week?
Oct 11, 2019, 12:41 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And i get 1 hour every week
Oct 11, 2019, 12:41 PM

Fraser Macdonald

George Hughes
That's what student life is like I guess, you'll already be used to it when you start uniüíÅüèº
Jun 9, 2019, 6:23 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha yeah but starting at 1
Jun 9, 2019, 5:26 PM
George Hughes

Jun 9, 2019, 5:14 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'm just tired man
Jun 9, 2019, 5:13 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Ugh
Jun 9, 2019, 5:13 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah for sure
Jun 9, 2019, 5:13 PM
George Hughes
Keep working hard but make sure you find time to relax too. You'll be just fine üòÅ
Jun 9, 2019, 5:01 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Got my work cut out tho haha
Jun 9, 2019, 4:08 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah it's so cool
Jun 9, 2019, 4:08 PM
George Hughes

Jun 9, 2019, 3:09 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha I try :) I have two books being published soon acc, a commission for a piano school
Jun 9, 2019, 2:24 PM
George Hughes
Would you ever write something like that?
Jun 9, 2019, 12:46 PM
George Hughes
Incredible
Jun 9, 2019, 12:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Kind of amazing eh
Jun 9, 2019, 12:18 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahahah
Jun 9, 2019, 12:18 PM
George Hughes
*slams keyboard lid*
Jun 9, 2019, 11:33 AM
George Hughes
Just finished the soft quintuplets in 9 then suddenly I'm attacked by all this movement in 10
Jun 9, 2019, 11:32 AM
George Hughes
Goodness me
Jun 9, 2019, 11:31 AM
George Hughes
Daamn
Jun 9, 2019, 11:31 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Yup Hahah
Jun 9, 2019, 11:31 AM
George Hughes
Even crazier?
Jun 9, 2019, 11:31 AM
Fraser Macdonald
It gets crazayyuyyy
Jun 9, 2019, 11:31 AM
George Hughes
Listening to Rzewski now, what crazy variations
Jun 9, 2019, 11:30 AM
George Hughes
That's a brilliant opportunity!
Jun 9, 2019, 11:30 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah it was with the rcs
Jun 9, 2019, 11:24 AM
George Hughes
Do you get private composition lessons?
Jun 9, 2019, 11:06 AM
Fraser Macdonald
")
Jun 9, 2019, 11:06 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah he is incredible
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
George Hughes
I'll put that one on after Byrd
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Fantastix
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
Fraser Macdonald
The people united will never be defeated
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
George Hughes
He sounds like a brilliant teacher
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
Fraser Macdonald
U will like
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Try the rzewski
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Some amazing ideas there
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
Fraser Macdonald
And my perceptions of music
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Like he chose them based on me
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Many of those are picked to push boundaries
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah
Jun 9, 2019, 11:05 AM
George Hughes
I mean like music in general, there's so many different ways to do it
Jun 9, 2019, 11:04 AM
George Hughes
I'll give them a listen, thanks
Jun 9, 2019, 11:04 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Very 60s
Jun 9, 2019, 11:03 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Not bach hahaha
Jun 9, 2019, 11:03 AM
George Hughes
Oooh
Jun 9, 2019, 11:03 AM
Fraser Macdonald
All the weekly listening homework from my composition lessons
Jun 9, 2019, 11:03 AM
George Hughes
Completely, music has no boundaries
Jun 9, 2019, 11:03 AM
Fraser Macdonald
My rcs composition list
Jun 9, 2019, 11:03 AM
Fraser Macdonald

Jun 9, 2019, 11:03 AM
Fraser Macdonald
It's a different kind of listening
Jun 9, 2019, 11:02 AM
George Hughes
I've been listening to some, I think I'm finally starting to appreciate Bach
Jun 9, 2019, 11:01 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Very :) try bachs 48 prelude and fugues
Jun 9, 2019, 11:00 AM
George Hughes
THanks, I'll do it now. Suitable listening for a sunday
Jun 9, 2019, 10:54 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Listen to 4 part mass by Byrd. Not a fugue but worth a listen
Jun 9, 2019, 10:53 AM
George Hughes
I listened to little fugue the other day and I just love the sound of the four parts. I wanted to hear more like it
Jun 9, 2019, 7:52 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Why fugues?
Jun 9, 2019, 12:00 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Every Bach fugue ever
Jun 9, 2019, 12:00 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Hmm
Jun 9, 2019, 12:00 AM
George Hughes
I want to listen to some fugues, can you recommend me any? :P
Jun 8, 2019, 7:22 PM
George Hughes
Oooh great choice! Must have been hard to pick!
Jun 8, 2019, 2:34 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Accepted Edinburgh
Jun 8, 2019, 2:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Don't care tho
Jun 8, 2019, 2:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah think so
Jun 8, 2019, 2:29 PM
George Hughes
Are you happy with how your exams went?
Jun 8, 2019, 11:48 AM
George Hughes
Hahah sounds like you'll be okay
Jun 8, 2019, 11:48 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Hopefully I don't fail advanced computing lol
Jun 8, 2019, 9:03 AM
Fraser Macdonald
That's what I thought
Jun 8, 2019, 9:03 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah
Jun 8, 2019, 9:03 AM
George Hughes
Aye it's pretty much as you said. Say you need a function which checks if a number is prime but you don't have time to write it, you could hard code a stub which can recognise the first 10 primes and put that in its place
Jun 7, 2019, 9:04 PM
George Hughes
Well either way I'll look into it now I've heard of it
Jun 7, 2019, 9:01 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Probably chatting shite
Jun 7, 2019, 9:00 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Honestly
Jun 7, 2019, 9:00 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha
Jun 7, 2019, 9:00 PM
George Hughes
Sounds like you've been learning more than I have üòÜ
Jun 7, 2019, 9:00 PM
George Hughes
Huh, that's good to know, thanks
Jun 7, 2019, 8:59 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Not entirely sure lol, I think they are replica bits of data, so u can check if a function works without having to use the proper calling procedure. Just like stand in variables
Jun 7, 2019, 8:54 PM
George Hughes
Stubs?
Jun 7, 2019, 8:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Fair enough Hahah, and that's all I know about it basically. Stubs nd drivers and shit
Jun 7, 2019, 8:48 PM
George Hughes
Ahh I suppose it's synonymous then. We never learned about component testing in high school, took until second year of uni for that
Jun 7, 2019, 8:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Just like procedures
Jun 7, 2019, 8:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah that's component testing for the sqa haha
Jun 7, 2019, 8:45 PM
George Hughes
It's kinda like that but for functions, it makes sure they give expected results
Jun 7, 2019, 8:43 PM
George Hughes
Component testing is physical components right?
Jun 7, 2019, 8:42 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Kinda, similar to component testing?
Jun 7, 2019, 8:42 PM
George Hughes
Ever heard of unit testing?
Jun 7, 2019, 8:41 PM
Fraser Macdonald
So what have they got you doing in your work
Jun 7, 2019, 8:40 PM
Fraser Macdonald
:)
Jun 7, 2019, 8:40 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hmm
Jun 7, 2019, 8:40 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha we will see
Jun 7, 2019, 8:40 PM
George Hughes
Brilliant, one day you'll be performing solo in Paris
Jun 7, 2019, 8:37 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Singing, with nycos
Jun 7, 2019, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
Oooh brilliant, which instrument?
Jun 7, 2019, 8:36 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha Nah not really, played a gig in Paris tho
Jun 7, 2019, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
Did you manage to get your trip to Europe?
Jun 7, 2019, 8:35 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahah
Jun 7, 2019, 8:34 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah I can imagine
Jun 7, 2019, 8:34 PM
George Hughes
Very
Jun 7, 2019, 8:28 PM
George Hughes
Although it's vert tiring
Jun 7, 2019, 8:28 PM
George Hughes
Really good, I love it
Jun 7, 2019, 8:28 PM
Fraser Macdonald
How's it going?
Jun 7, 2019, 7:53 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Aw amazing
Jun 7, 2019, 7:53 PM
George Hughes
Btw, just finished my first ever week of work
Jun 7, 2019, 7:18 PM
George Hughes
Hundred percent
Jun 7, 2019, 7:17 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But I'm down to try it
Jun 7, 2019, 7:08 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah true
Jun 7, 2019, 7:07 PM
George Hughes
I guess virtual currencies are the craze now, wonder if the damage from bitcoin has been forgotten enough yet
Jun 7, 2019, 7:03 PM
George Hughes
I wouldn't say bollocks, it's just a mutual agreement
Jun 7, 2019, 7:02 PM
Fraser Macdonald
U can already buy shit w them
Jun 7, 2019, 6:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
When u accept that all money is bollocks
Jun 7, 2019, 6:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
They are trying to create a virtual vurrency
Jun 7, 2019, 6:47 PM
George Hughes
I guess you never know
Jun 7, 2019, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
Hmm I think it might come across too much as a scam for it to be big, but I'll take a look
Jun 7, 2019, 6:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But it might become the next big thing
Jun 7, 2019, 6:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nothing to lose
Jun 7, 2019, 6:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It might die
Jun 7, 2019, 6:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The more money
Jun 7, 2019, 6:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And the more social interaction
Jun 7, 2019, 6:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
U get paid for living
Jun 7, 2019, 6:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It might be nothing
Jun 7, 2019, 6:44 PM
George Hughes
What does it do?
Jun 7, 2019, 6:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It's an interesting concept
Jun 7, 2019, 6:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
For real man
Jun 7, 2019, 6:43 PM
Fraser Macdonald
No
Jun 7, 2019, 6:43 PM
George Hughes
Hacked?
Jun 7, 2019, 6:43 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I live. I get paid. I am on Nimses. G–µt the app and earn 1440 nims now.

Jun 7, 2019, 6:43 PM
George Hughes
Incredible
Apr 10, 2019, 11:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
so we see darkness where they "should" be
Apr 10, 2019, 11:02 PM
Fraser Macdonald
but the light is bent through it
Apr 10, 2019, 11:02 PM
George Hughes
Ahhh awesome!
Apr 10, 2019, 11:02 PM
Fraser Macdonald
there are millions of stars around it
Apr 10, 2019, 11:02 PM
Fraser Macdonald
its the galaxy
Apr 10, 2019, 11:02 PM
George Hughes
I'm not entirely sure but my guess would be either from the energy created by having a huge number of objects drawn into the area around it. Most likely it's the stars beyond it (from out perspective) but I'm a layman
Apr 10, 2019, 5:21 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Is it just from all the stars around it
Apr 10, 2019, 5:19 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Where is the light coming from
Apr 10, 2019, 5:19 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I suppose I mean
Apr 10, 2019, 5:19 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Sure, that makes sense
Apr 10, 2019, 5:19 PM
George Hughes
Ofc
Apr 10, 2019, 5:19 PM
George Hughes
Then it's black in the middle because no light can escape from beyond a certain point
Apr 10, 2019, 5:19 PM
George Hughes
Space is sort of pinched inward so all the light from around it appears like it's pulled into the area around it
Apr 10, 2019, 5:18 PM
George Hughes
You're seeing the light that is bending because of the warping caused by the huge mass of the black hole
Apr 10, 2019, 5:18 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Why is there light
Apr 10, 2019, 5:16 PM
Fraser Macdonald
So what am I looking at
Apr 10, 2019, 5:16 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's amazing
Apr 10, 2019, 5:16 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah I googled it
Apr 10, 2019, 5:16 PM
George Hughes
Looks like a photo my phone took but it's super good news for the world of physics
Apr 10, 2019, 5:15 PM
George Hughes

Apr 10, 2019, 5:14 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I need to see that shit
Apr 10, 2019, 5:13 PM
George Hughes
The first ever photo of a black hole has been taken by scientists!
Apr 10, 2019, 5:11 PM
Fraser Macdonald
No??
Apr 10, 2019, 4:18 PM
George Hughes
Great news for physics! Have you heard?
Apr 10, 2019, 2:21 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Apr 3, 2019, 12:19 PM
George Hughes
It's all good my dude, enjoy!
Apr 3, 2019, 10:17 AM
Fraser Macdonald
I'm at music camp sorry brother
Apr 3, 2019, 1:10 AM
George Hughes
I'll be in Perth for the next few days, fancy a catch up and maybe a jam?
Apr 1, 2019, 5:20 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Haha true
Mar 27, 2019, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
:D
Mar 27, 2019, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
It'll make it easier to sound like Jacob Collier
Mar 27, 2019, 5:00 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hmm sounds interesting
Mar 27, 2019, 4:58 PM
George Hughes
So choose your key and then play justly tuned midi :P
Mar 27, 2019, 4:55 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah for sure
Mar 27, 2019, 4:54 PM
George Hughes
I think anyway
Mar 27, 2019, 4:54 PM
George Hughes
Well you can if it only plays in one key üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Mar 27, 2019, 4:54 PM
Fraser Macdonald
U can't have a justly tuned piano ahaha
Mar 27, 2019, 4:54 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But that makes no sense
Mar 27, 2019, 4:53 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I know what it is
Mar 27, 2019, 4:53 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Eh?
Mar 27, 2019, 4:53 PM
George Hughes
There's a new midi standard being worked on that will allow you to tune your piano justly!
Mar 27, 2019, 1:56 PM
George Hughes
You'll know what just intonation is won't you?
Mar 27, 2019, 1:55 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Oh yeah for sure
Mar 26, 2019, 10:08 PM
George Hughes
That works too but you can't have multiple parts that way
Mar 26, 2019, 8:28 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Fair enough, I sing loads of shit into my recordings hahah
Mar 26, 2019, 8:14 PM
George Hughes
Hahah thanks! it's been stuck in my head the past week so I decided to write it down
Mar 26, 2019, 8:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It's a nice wee ditty man
Mar 26, 2019, 8:07 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha I like ot
Mar 26, 2019, 8:07 PM
George Hughes
üòÅ
Mar 26, 2019, 8:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Will do man x
Mar 26, 2019, 8:04 PM
George Hughes
Hope you like it
Mar 26, 2019, 8:03 PM
George Hughes
Awesome üòÅ
Mar 26, 2019, 8:03 PM
George Hughes
Aye*
Mar 26, 2019, 8:03 PM
George Hughes
Aye ayet
Mar 26, 2019, 8:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Will have a try tonite
Mar 26, 2019, 8:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
For piano?
Mar 26, 2019, 8:02 PM
George Hughes
I did a thing
Mar 26, 2019, 7:50 PM
George Hughes

Mar 26, 2019, 7:50 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha hopefully
Mar 24, 2019, 8:55 PM
George Hughes
Tbf once you can play that well, I'd imagine a lot of people are gonna pay a lot of money to have you play
Mar 24, 2019, 12:24 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha yeah, I'm leaning chopin, fantasie impromptu rn, will be happy if I master that in 5 months or so
Mar 24, 2019, 12:16 AM
George Hughes
Jeez, months at your level üòÆ
Mar 24, 2019, 12:14 AM
Fraser Macdonald
I play the first one, Dr Gradus ad parnassum, and I'm still perfecting it, but literally months
Mar 24, 2019, 12:12 AM
George Hughes
How long did it take you to learn those? You play them right?
Mar 24, 2019, 12:11 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah even his children's corner is v hard
Mar 24, 2019, 12:10 AM
George Hughes
I bought sheets for the suite bergamasque but I realised that it's gonna be years before I can play them as soon as I opened it hahah
Mar 24, 2019, 12:07 AM
Fraser Macdonald
That's fair. Debussy is very hard, impressionist but accurate to a point
Mar 24, 2019, 12:05 AM
George Hughes
No that was Mozart, but Debussys music is what I really want to play
Mar 24, 2019, 12:04 AM
Fraser Macdonald
That's true, was it debussy u were playing there
Mar 24, 2019, 12:03 AM
George Hughes
I'm on it, there doesn't seem to be much for Debussy unfortunately
Mar 23, 2019, 11:58 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Interpretation masterclasses
Mar 23, 2019, 11:56 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But yeah
Mar 23, 2019, 11:56 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And conducting skill tbf
Mar 23, 2019, 11:56 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Cause they are all about interpretation
Mar 23, 2019, 11:56 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Conducting masterclasses are good
Mar 23, 2019, 11:56 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Possibly yeah
Mar 23, 2019, 11:56 PM
George Hughes
You*
Mar 23, 2019, 11:56 PM
George Hughes
I think up might have showed me a video of him when you came over
Mar 23, 2019, 11:55 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Benjamin Zander is the king of conducting masterclasses
Mar 23, 2019, 11:55 PM
George Hughes
I'll do just that
Mar 23, 2019, 11:53 PM
Fraser Macdonald
A lot
Mar 23, 2019, 11:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It's worth
Mar 23, 2019, 11:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Just as much as u can
Mar 23, 2019, 11:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Piano, but also voice and others
Mar 23, 2019, 11:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Defo watch some interpretation masterclasses on YouTube
üëçGeorge Hughes
Mar 23, 2019, 11:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It will set u apart
Mar 23, 2019, 11:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But u have such a good musical and emotional intelligence
Mar 23, 2019, 11:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
At that level it is less important
Mar 23, 2019, 11:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But really study the music
Mar 23, 2019, 11:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It takes a lifetime to master
Mar 23, 2019, 11:51 PM
Fraser Macdonald
To be frank
Mar 23, 2019, 11:51 PM
George Hughes
Thanks so much!
Mar 23, 2019, 11:51 PM
George Hughes
Okay I think I follow, I'll be aware of that next time I play
Mar 23, 2019, 11:51 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It's about unlocking, and conveying that
Mar 23, 2019, 11:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Each phrase in a work has a purpose
Mar 23, 2019, 11:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Each chord in a line has a pjrpose
Mar 23, 2019, 11:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Each note in a chord has a purpose
Mar 23, 2019, 11:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Functional harmony
Mar 23, 2019, 11:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
For example
Mar 23, 2019, 11:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
= the emotion behind the notes
Mar 23, 2019, 11:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Cause there is emotion missing
Mar 23, 2019, 11:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But it would never be a good kiss
Mar 23, 2019, 11:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
= the notes
Mar 23, 2019, 11:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It would follow physical commands
Mar 23, 2019, 11:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Imagine programming a robot to kiss someone
Mar 23, 2019, 11:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But I meant more
Mar 23, 2019, 11:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Like in a build up
Mar 23, 2019, 11:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But the music can be tense, in the right moment
Mar 23, 2019, 11:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Well yeah
Mar 23, 2019, 11:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I mean like
Mar 23, 2019, 11:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
No aha
Mar 23, 2019, 11:46 PM
George Hughes
I think I get you, but when you say it's like a hug, you mean it's relaxed and filled with feeling rather than tense and awkward?
Mar 23, 2019, 9:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
U get me
Mar 23, 2019, 9:42 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But it needs more to mean anything
Mar 23, 2019, 9:42 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It's like a hug, the notes are the instructions
Mar 23, 2019, 9:42 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah, and expressing the music behind the notes
Mar 23, 2019, 9:42 PM
George Hughes
Rather than just playing it?
Mar 23, 2019, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
So it's a case of feeling the music more?
Mar 23, 2019, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
‚ù§Ô∏è
Mar 23, 2019, 9:37 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Amazing job xx
Mar 23, 2019, 9:37 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But yeah
Mar 23, 2019, 9:37 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It's hard to put into words
Mar 23, 2019, 9:37 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The brilliance
Mar 23, 2019, 9:37 PM
Fraser Macdonald
As in moments of light
Mar 23, 2019, 9:37 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah think about light
Mar 23, 2019, 9:36 PM
George Hughes
Got it. Thanks so much!
Mar 23, 2019, 9:35 PM
George Hughes
And think about phrasing
Mar 23, 2019, 9:35 PM
George Hughes
Play it how I'd sing it, breathe with it and take inspiration from how others play it, I'll do those
Mar 23, 2019, 9:34 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And take what u like, don't copy, but steal the phrasing and inflections u like
Mar 23, 2019, 9:28 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Listen to others playing it
Mar 23, 2019, 9:28 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Literally breathing with the music helps
Mar 23, 2019, 9:28 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The secret is to keep it in the style of the period, whilst allowing the music to soar
Mar 23, 2019, 9:27 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Each phrase has a mini climax and ending
Mar 23, 2019, 9:27 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Think about how u would play it on a violin or sing it
Mar 23, 2019, 9:27 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That sort of music is all about tension and release, moments of build, and moments of light. It all needs to remain "above board", so not romantic, but it needs to breath and sing if u get me
Mar 23, 2019, 9:26 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Think about phrases
Mar 23, 2019, 9:26 PM
Fraser Macdonald
So
Mar 23, 2019, 9:26 PM
George Hughes
I would loooove some high level tips
Mar 23, 2019, 9:23 PM
George Hughes
Wow thanks so much ‚ù§Ô∏è means so much coming from you!
Mar 23, 2019, 9:23 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The timing was unnoticeable man, u would notice but no one else would have xx
Mar 23, 2019, 9:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Cause that was v good my bro xx
Mar 23, 2019, 9:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Fancy some high level tips?
Mar 23, 2019, 9:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'm incredibly impressrd
Mar 23, 2019, 9:22 PM
George Hughes
(I'm aware the timing is painfully atrocious)
Mar 23, 2019, 9:12 PM
George Hughes
Thought you might like to see how your student is coming along ;)
Mar 23, 2019, 9:11 PM
George Hughes
Mar 23, 2019, 9:11 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Haha yeah perhaps
Mar 17, 2019, 9:24 PM
George Hughes
Huh it seems that it's created an account with a duplicate email ,better fix that
Mar 17, 2019, 9:23 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hmmm That's weird, fair enough
Mar 17, 2019, 8:40 PM
George Hughes
That's something else I'm unsure of cause the API we're using doesn't let you get email for a specific user so I've swapped it over to the db, but that won't take effect until its deployed
Mar 17, 2019, 8:28 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But with the same email?
Mar 17, 2019, 8:24 PM
George Hughes
It looks like you created a new account
Mar 17, 2019, 8:06 PM
George Hughes
That's sketchy
Mar 17, 2019, 8:05 PM
George Hughes
Hmmmm
Mar 17, 2019, 8:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It could just be the servers taking a while, but I don't think the save changes button on the edit account page works
Mar 17, 2019, 8:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But I'm back in hahaha
Mar 17, 2019, 8:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
My account should be blacklisted
Mar 17, 2019, 8:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Not sure how
Mar 17, 2019, 8:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'm back in
Mar 17, 2019, 8:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Wait
Mar 17, 2019, 8:04 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Ah
Mar 17, 2019, 8:04 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Mar 17, 2019, 8:03 PM
George Hughes
Hmm that's good to know
Mar 17, 2019, 8:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But there is no error
Mar 17, 2019, 8:03 PM
George Hughes
It won't let you I don't think
Mar 17, 2019, 8:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Like it won't let me submit
Mar 17, 2019, 8:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nothing happens
Mar 17, 2019, 8:03 PM
George Hughes
Although you can just make a new account
Mar 17, 2019, 8:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
If I try and make a new account with the same email
Mar 17, 2019, 8:03 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha nice one
Mar 17, 2019, 8:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Alrhoguht
Mar 17, 2019, 8:02 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'm blacklisted
Mar 17, 2019, 8:02 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It worked
Mar 17, 2019, 8:02 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha I'll try and log in in a mon
Mar 17, 2019, 7:59 PM
George Hughes
Although dunno if it'll work, we haven't really tested it yet
Mar 17, 2019, 7:58 PM
George Hughes
Done hahah
Mar 17, 2019, 7:58 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha blacklist me
Mar 17, 2019, 7:57 PM
George Hughes
üòÜüòÜ
Mar 17, 2019, 5:14 PM
George Hughes

Mar 17, 2019, 5:14 PM
George Hughes
I want to default date entry to the current date and time
Mar 17, 2019, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
Huh so it doesn't,thanks for pointing that out
Mar 17, 2019, 5:00 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The report function does nothing when u submit reports, so it's hard to know if it worked
Mar 17, 2019, 4:42 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I think the date entry is a bit clunky, but it all works so far
Mar 17, 2019, 4:38 PM
George Hughes
We've got an expo tomorrow so I've gotta focus on clearing out the rest of the bugs. We're at www.besterbikes.com if you want to try and break it.
https://www.besterbikes.com/
Mar 17, 2019, 4:35 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah I'm v excited man
Mar 17, 2019, 4:06 PM
George Hughes
I defo think we can create something amazing though
Mar 17, 2019, 3:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah for sure man
Mar 17, 2019, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
Thanks so much! It really means a lot! But don't forget about your own plans ;)
Mar 17, 2019, 3:47 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'm more than happy to be as involved as u want me to be
Mar 17, 2019, 3:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
This sounds cool
Mar 17, 2019, 3:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah
Mar 17, 2019, 3:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Haha
Mar 17, 2019, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
Oh tell me about it üòÇ
Mar 17, 2019, 3:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
U clearly need my expertise
Mar 17, 2019, 3:45 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It's an integral part
Mar 17, 2019, 3:45 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Haha I mean yeha
Mar 17, 2019, 3:45 PM
George Hughes
Hahahah I thought it was some kind of business role
Mar 17, 2019, 3:45 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahahah
Mar 17, 2019, 3:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Ya*
Mar 17, 2019, 3:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It's a spelling mistake hehe
Mar 17, 2019, 3:44 PM
George Hughes
But I'd for sure trust your judgement
Mar 17, 2019, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
I don't even know what 6a is üíÅüèºüòÇ
Mar 17, 2019, 3:32 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Lol pay me, I'll manage it for 6a
Mar 17, 2019, 3:24 PM
George Hughes
Not a clue, I think I'd have to pay someone to worry about that kind of thing.. All I'm good for is creating the product üíÅüèº
Mar 17, 2019, 2:17 PM
Fraser Macdonald
What's the share structure of your company gonna be?
Mar 17, 2019, 11:50 AM
George Hughes
Thanks so much!
Mar 16, 2019, 9:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's so cool, yeah man I'd love to help, in any way
Mar 16, 2019, 5:01 PM
George Hughes
I'll make a point of having a study ready way before exam and deadline times, I'm super excited
Mar 16, 2019, 4:41 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Plan
Mar 16, 2019, 4:39 PM
George Hughes
Awwh thanks so much!! That would be claaaass
Mar 16, 2019, 4:38 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahah 100%%% yes man. Sound amazing. U can use any ed uni facilities I can get us into as well bro
Mar 16, 2019, 4:38 PM
George Hughes
Awesome! Thanks so much for your support btw, really means a lot! If an app or anything comes of it, you're first in line for a share ;)
Mar 16, 2019, 4:36 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Defo go for that
Mar 16, 2019, 4:35 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha that looks sick
Mar 16, 2019, 4:35 PM
George Hughes
So I've got your Bach there;)
Mar 16, 2019, 4:33 PM
George Hughes
I mean what I was considering at the end of the day was what the professor I'm working with called "type select" or something.. Meaning I train it on a bunch of different composers and choose how much of each composer I want to influence the new piece, 90% Bach with some impressionist from Debussy thrown in say üíÅüèº
Mar 16, 2019, 4:32 PM
George Hughes
Hahahah
Mar 16, 2019, 4:31 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Mozart is a meh from me
Mar 16, 2019, 4:31 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I would kill for more
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
They ar legendary
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
40 preludes and fuges
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Bach produced over 400 chorals
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And the music is better
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The rules are easier to quantize
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Do Bach
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Don't do mozart
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Big ask
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Very happy to help
Mar 16, 2019, 4:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah
Mar 16, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's cool
Mar 16, 2019, 4:29 PM
George Hughes
Pretty much my thoughts
Mar 16, 2019, 4:29 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's fair, you could make an app, 1 new excersice a day
Mar 16, 2019, 4:28 PM
George Hughes
So essentially if you want to be good at playing Mozart but get bored of playing the same thing over and over, this would solve that
Mar 16, 2019, 4:28 PM
George Hughes
I actually have an answer to that but it's based on speculation: our generation have shortened attention spans due to the Internet so we're always looking for new information to consume. A constant stream of new music inspired by Mozart could encourage people to remain focused
Mar 16, 2019, 4:27 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I get you, and no, I am just struggling to see why anyone would play ai mozart over mozart
Mar 16, 2019, 4:25 PM
George Hughes
Do you think I'm going in out of my depth?
Mar 16, 2019, 3:36 PM
George Hughes
But for my purposes, I can't imagine it'll cause any major problems
Mar 16, 2019, 3:06 PM
George Hughes
I suppose the semantics of what is correct could get in the way
Mar 16, 2019, 3:05 PM
George Hughes
So maybe learn is the wrong word, progress would be the word
Mar 16, 2019, 3:05 PM
George Hughes
Well what I want to show is that someone who trains on Mozart inspired AI music would progress quicker than someone who just practises scales or other composers.. Although I haven't figured out how to do a control group yet
Mar 16, 2019, 3:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Is it just notes, dynamics, phrases, rhythms
Mar 16, 2019, 2:33 PM
Fraser Macdonald
What is your definition of learn to play mozart
Mar 16, 2019, 2:33 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Well
Mar 16, 2019, 2:32 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Cause the best pianists in the world spend their lives arguing about how to play it, and trying to perfect it
Mar 16, 2019, 2:32 PM
George Hughes
Thanks! Analysis as in structure?
Hahah what makes you think not?
Mar 16, 2019, 2:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
the notes and style is all very well, but mzart is full of subtlety
Mar 16, 2019, 2:24 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But I must warn you, there is another level of analysis u must reach
Mar 16, 2019, 2:24 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'm up for it
Mar 16, 2019, 2:23 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha
Mar 16, 2019, 2:23 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's fair, and almost certainly not
Mar 16, 2019, 2:23 PM
George Hughes
So I want to show that music generated by an artificial intelligence to emulate a certain composer's style will improve a pianist's ability to learn actual works by that composer.

Imagine a program that generates an endless stream of Mozart music, if you practise using that, will your ability to learn and play Mozart improve? That's what I want to answer :P
Mar 16, 2019, 12:32 PM
George Hughes
Awesome!!
Mar 16, 2019, 12:30 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Oh right that's fine yeah sounds good, go for it
Mar 16, 2019, 11:08 AM
George Hughes
I haven't started planning it yet but it'll take possibly a few hours. It's a long way off yet though. I can explain the study I'm planning to do if you like?
Mar 16, 2019, 10:20 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah sounds good, bit busy rn, what's the timescale?
Mar 15, 2019, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
Hey bro, I'm planning a big study for my dissertation next year involving piano and classical music, I thought I'd ask sooner rather than later since having you on board would probably make it successful; would you fancy helping me out? üòÅ
Mar 15, 2019, 12:36 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Oh cool I'll check it out
Mar 4, 2019, 8:54 AM
George Hughes
it's like chat rooms but for piano ,and yeah it supports midi. It's maybe a little gimmicky but it's kinda fun to play about in
Feb 25, 2019, 10:39 AM
Fraser Macdonald
And just midi plugin?
Feb 25, 2019, 8:48 AM
Fraser Macdonald
What is this?
Feb 25, 2019, 8:48 AM

George Hughes
Got a good story out of it, and the folk interviewing me seemed to like it
Feb 9, 2019, 11:13 PM
George Hughes
Well there's not much to tell but she was an engineering student and she couldn't program for shit, but she needed to do C++ for coursework, so she came to me. I ended up getting a date üíÅüèº that was ages ago tho
Feb 9, 2019, 11:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
tell me about it
Feb 9, 2019, 11:11 PM
Fraser Macdonald
hahaha
Feb 9, 2019, 11:10 PM
George Hughes
In the interview, they asked if I had any experience with C++ and I told them about the time I learned it to impress a girl
Feb 9, 2019, 11:10 PM
Fraser Macdonald
AT MOTHER FUCKING RENISHAW
Feb 9, 2019, 11:04 PM

That was basically my reaction though, I was dancing around in my living room for like 5 minutes
Feb 9, 2019, 10:55 PM
George Hughes
Even my parents didn't react so extravagantly üòÅ

I spent about four hours this afternoon practising today and three hours yesterday, it's becoming very comfortable to play and I can read so much quicker now.
And university is such hard work but I'm enjoying it a lot
Feb 9, 2019, 10:49 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah that's totally fair. How are they going?
Feb 9, 2019, 10:33 PM

Oct 7, 2018, 11:14 PM
Fraser Macdonald
ill show u tomorrow
Oct 7, 2018, 11:14 PM
Fraser Macdonald
sounds stupid but it should improve your normal playing and make it more fluid
Oct 7, 2018, 11:14 PM
George Hughes
I gotcha
Oct 7, 2018, 11:14 PM
Fraser Macdonald
so u need to sing the nots
Oct 7, 2018, 11:13 PM

Oct 7, 2018, 11:13 PM

Oct 7, 2018, 11:13 PM
Fraser Macdonald
hard to eplain
Oct 7, 2018, 11:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Oct 7, 2018, 11:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
the full arm, wrist and hand is just leaning into the note
Oct 7, 2018, 11:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
a really rich legato line
Oct 7, 2018, 11:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
iagine you are playing a cello
Oct 7, 2018, 11:11 PM
Fraser Macdonald
almost forear
Oct 7, 2018, 11:11 PM
George Hughes
Should the pressing be from my fingers or elsewhere?
Oct 7, 2018, 11:11 PM
Fraser Macdonald
but a world of difference on a real piano and to your techniwue
Oct 7, 2018, 11:10 PM
Fraser Macdonald
it wont make an audible difference on an electric
Oct 7, 2018, 11:10 PM
Fraser Macdonald
really press down the keys
Oct 7, 2018, 11:10 PM
Fraser Macdonald
elecctric pianos teach detached playing cause of their false reverb
Oct 7, 2018, 11:10 PM
George Hughes
Lean into the keys?
Oct 7, 2018, 11:10 PM
Fraser Macdonald
really lean into the keys and play with legato
Oct 7, 2018, 11:10 PM
Fraser Macdonald
try and find a good grand piano
Oct 7, 2018, 11:09 PM
Fraser Macdonald
it should be as fluid and easy as possible
Oct 7, 2018, 11:09 PM
Fraser Macdonald
yeah so it could be that u are moving your wrist too sharply
Oct 7, 2018, 11:09 PM
George Hughes
I'll try those
Oct 7, 2018, 11:09 PM
Fraser Macdonald
wait
Oct 7, 2018, 11:09 PM
Fraser Macdonald
hm
Oct 7, 2018, 11:09 PM
Fraser Macdonald
so try and fold all 4 of your fingers over when u go c to g
Oct 7, 2018, 11:08 PM
Fraser Macdonald
the other is just technique
Oct 7, 2018, 11:07 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Oct 7, 2018, 11:07 PM
Fraser Macdonald
2
Oct 7, 2018, 11:07 PM
George Hughes
I'll try that
Oct 7, 2018, 11:07 PM
George Hughes
It really only hurts when I'm going down the piano when I go from the C to a G
Oct 7, 2018, 11:07 PM
Fraser Macdonald
more fluidity: try and move your wrist up and down the keyboard at a constant speed
Oct 7, 2018, 11:07 PM
Fraser Macdonald
2 things to try
Oct 7, 2018, 11:06 PM
Fraser Macdonald
oh
Oct 7, 2018, 11:06 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Oct 7, 2018, 11:06 PM

George Hughes
That motion

Oct 7, 2018, 11:06 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Oct 7, 2018, 11:05 PM
George Hughes
It's only my right hand, and it's when I rotate my hand to the left
Oct 7, 2018, 11:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
when that side is stretched or leghthened?
Oct 7, 2018, 11:04 PM
Fraser Macdonald
and when does it hurt
Oct 7, 2018, 11:04 PM
George Hughes
I think it's called the ulnar side, the side with the pinky
Oct 7, 2018, 11:04 PM
Fraser Macdonald
where is it hurting your wrist?
Oct 7, 2018, 11:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Sep 16, 2018, 11:53 AM
George Hughes
We can ask for more
Sep 16, 2018, 11:52 AM
Fraser Macdonald
And less money for literally no reason
Sep 16, 2018, 11:39 AM
George Hughes
I suppose because it'll be fun to have lead and rhythm guitar, keys, vocals and drums
Sep 16, 2018, 11:36 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Why?
Sep 16, 2018, 11:35 AM
George Hughes

Fraser Macdonald

Sep 15, 2018, 4:19 PM
George Hughes
Fraser, don't tell him I said this but I'm a little worried that Ben is gonna try something tonight, cause he got physical last time i saw him.. He wouldn't actually do anything right?
Sep 15, 2018, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
Thanks for understanding
Sep 15, 2018, 1:32 PM
George Hughes

Sep 15, 2018, 1:31 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Mate it's chill, I get uni needs to come firsy
Sep 15, 2018, 1:31 PM
George Hughes
Sorry dude, I guess I'm not thinking rationally
Sep 15, 2018, 1:31 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Well we defo would have
Sep 15, 2018, 1:26 PM
George Hughes
Give the Caley and the Venue a shout and they'll give you a slot, but Ben said you and Fabio wouldn't have been able to play for three hours
Sep 15, 2018, 1:17 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Ben is basically done btw
Sep 15, 2018, 1:01 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Well I understand that u can't make the gigs but u shouldn't have cancled, that's a lot of money for me and we could have found cover
Sep 15, 2018, 1:01 PM
George Hughes
If*
Sep 15, 2018, 12:45 PM
George Hughes
Yo I dunno of Ben has told you but I've cancelled all the gigs we had left this month because of uni. Sorry I had to do it, but I hope you understand.
Sep 15, 2018, 12:42 PM
George Hughes
I managed to work key sigs in after 6 hours of toil
Sep 8, 2018, 12:14 AM
George Hughes

Sep 8, 2018, 12:14 AM
George Hughes
Also the different colours are different difficulties
Sep 7, 2018, 10:31 PM
George Hughes
Oh the graph is volatile cause I keep developing it so it's not very consistent
Sep 7, 2018, 10:31 PM
George Hughes
Lmao
Sep 7, 2018, 10:08 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Sep 7, 2018, 9:08 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahaha you are.. volatile
Sep 7, 2018, 9:08 PM
George Hughes

Sep 7, 2018, 11:35 AM
George Hughes
And I wrote another one to track my progress üòé
Sep 7, 2018, 11:35 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Oh sickkkk
Sep 6, 2018, 4:02 PM
George Hughes
Yeah it comes up with random notes and displays them on a scrolling sheet, every time you play the right note(s) it goes to the next one
Aug 31, 2018, 11:57 PM
Fraser Macdonald
So you just play the notes?
Aug 31, 2018, 6:34 PM
George Hughes

Aug 31, 2018, 2:08 PM
George Hughes
It's a quiz like the chord inversions one I made, except for sight reading
Aug 30, 2018, 11:17 PM
George Hughes

Aug 30, 2018, 11:17 PM
George Hughes
Lemme show you what I've done since
Aug 30, 2018, 11:17 PM
Fraser Macdonald
So make a better one and u are in the money
Aug 30, 2018, 10:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
But it's also rubbish aha
Aug 30, 2018, 10:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah musescore does that it's so helpful
Aug 30, 2018, 10:03 PM
George Hughes
But imagine the possibilities for making educational programs
Aug 30, 2018, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
Absolute nightmare to code
Aug 30, 2018, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
I wrote a program that takes midi input and displays it on a stave
Aug 30, 2018, 8:36 PM
George Hughes

Aug 30, 2018, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
Check dis out
Aug 30, 2018, 8:35 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah
Aug 12, 2018, 12:22 PM
George Hughes
Lemme know make and model when you go back in
Aug 12, 2018, 12:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah they do
Aug 12, 2018, 12:22 PM
George Hughes
You mean an output jack?
Aug 12, 2018, 12:22 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It does have plugins
Aug 12, 2018, 12:21 PM
George Hughes
If they have amps
Aug 12, 2018, 12:21 PM
George Hughes
Ask if you can play it and try plugging it in
Aug 12, 2018, 12:21 PM
George Hughes
Huh
Aug 12, 2018, 12:20 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It's electroacoustic
Aug 12, 2018, 12:20 PM
George Hughes
The curved back isn't really anything special, and for that price it's probably not electro acoustic
Aug 12, 2018, 12:20 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Not sure, I'll take them when I go back in
Aug 12, 2018, 12:20 PM
George Hughes
Send some pics, what make is it?
Aug 12, 2018, 12:19 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I might go in later and I can send u some pictures of it
Aug 12, 2018, 12:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Think it's worth it?
Aug 12, 2018, 12:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
50 quid
Aug 12, 2018, 12:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The curved back
Aug 12, 2018, 12:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Saw an electro acoustic in a shop
Same backing as yours
Aug 12, 2018, 12:12 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hey mate
Aug 12, 2018, 12:11 PM
George Hughes
Haha
Jul 29, 2018, 7:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald

George Hughes
Hahah my playing or the app? :p
Jul 29, 2018, 6:59 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That sucks
Jul 29, 2018, 6:55 PM
George Hughes
Should be up now tho
Jul 29, 2018, 6:55 PM
George Hughes
Messenger lite doesn't seem to let me do that
Jul 29, 2018, 6:54 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Can u not just send it on messenger?
Jul 29, 2018, 6:54 PM
George Hughes
It seems to be taking its sweet time uploading to Google drive
Jul 29, 2018, 6:51 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The vid isn't loading
Jul 29, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Lemme know if you ever need any tips for guitar, least I can do
Jul 29, 2018, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Cheers

Better get that finger on the protein then
Jul 29, 2018, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
That does make sense
Jul 29, 2018, 6:45 PM
George Hughes
Ahh
Jul 29, 2018, 6:45 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Normally the last note of a scale is written as a crotchet where as everything else is quavers. Because 2 is a stronger finger than 4 u want to end on the 2
Jul 29, 2018, 6:45 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's correct but it's good practice to end on 2
Jul 29, 2018, 6:44 PM
George Hughes
That's my right hand

Jul 29, 2018, 6:33 PM
Fraser Macdonald
All g
Jul 29, 2018, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
Thanks for the pointers for the other scales btw
Jul 29, 2018, 5:49 PM
George Hughes
I was doing it like an F major scale where I play Bb with my 3rd finger, that seems to work. Is that wrong?
Jul 29, 2018, 5:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah only use your pinky once in the full scale
Jul 29, 2018, 5:47 PM
George Hughes
Shouldn't each octave have the same pattern?
Jul 29, 2018, 5:46 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah but it's the fastest way for sure
Jul 29, 2018, 5:46 PM
George Hughes
But I get ya
Jul 29, 2018, 5:46 PM
George Hughes
That seems really unintuitive :(
Jul 29, 2018, 5:45 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's two octaves
Jul 29, 2018, 5:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
2 1 2 3 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 1 2 3 4
Jul 29, 2018, 5:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Rh fingering for Bb goes
Jul 29, 2018, 5:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Bb R2 then R1 that's important. L3
Jul 29, 2018, 5:44 PM
Fraser Macdonald
G# R3 L 3
Jul 29, 2018, 5:43 PM
Fraser Macdonald
F# R2 L4
Jul 29, 2018, 5:42 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Eb - L3 R2
Jul 29, 2018, 5:42 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Db - R2, L3
Jul 29, 2018, 5:42 PM
George Hughes
Start with Bb?
Jul 29, 2018, 5:42 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Sorry that's wrong
Jul 29, 2018, 5:41 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Db - R thumb. L middle finger
Jul 29, 2018, 5:41 PM
Fraser Macdonald
One sec
Jul 29, 2018, 5:41 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah so..
Jul 29, 2018, 5:41 PM
George Hughes
For the major scales starting on white keys, i start from my pinky of left hand and thumb on right, yeah? But the flat scales are different, right?
Jul 29, 2018, 5:39 PM
George Hughes
Really cool song

Jul 29, 2018, 10:50 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah I never used them
Jul 29, 2018, 10:47 AM
George Hughes
Oh yeah the chat bubbles, that was quite annoying
Jul 29, 2018, 10:47 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah true, and the bubble doesn't appear over apps
Jul 29, 2018, 10:47 AM
George Hughes
This just says Sent and Seen
Jul 29, 2018, 10:46 AM
George Hughes
I mean things like the seen bubble which slides down the screen when someone sees your message
Jul 29, 2018, 10:46 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Did anyone use them?
Jul 29, 2018, 10:46 AM
George Hughes
That
Jul 29, 2018, 10:45 AM
George Hughes
And all thag
Jul 29, 2018, 10:45 AM
George Hughes
But it doesn't have all the fancy animations
Jul 29, 2018, 10:45 AM
George Hughes
It looks good yeah
Jul 29, 2018, 10:45 AM
Fraser Macdonald
But it looks good
Jul 29, 2018, 10:45 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Like it is plain yeah
Jul 29, 2018, 10:45 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah i think it's pretty
Jul 29, 2018, 10:45 AM
George Hughes
I wonder why Facebook decided they needed a more practical less pretty app
Jul 29, 2018, 10:45 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Haha tis
Jul 29, 2018, 10:44 AM
George Hughes
It seems practical
Jul 29, 2018, 10:44 AM
George Hughes
I'm kinda indifferent tbh, but it seems a little quicker and it should save me precious data hahah
Jul 29, 2018, 10:44 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Like it?
Jul 29, 2018, 10:43 AM
George Hughes
Sweet Ive got it

Jul 29, 2018, 10:29 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahahaha that's class
Jul 29, 2018, 10:28 AM

Jul 29, 2018, 10:24 AM

Hahah
Jul 29, 2018, 10:24 AM

It's just great
Jul 29, 2018, 10:23 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Because of that
Jul 29, 2018, 10:23 AM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah and it sends messages faster
Jul 29, 2018, 10:23 AM
George Hughes
It takes up less space and uses less data doesn't it?
Jul 29, 2018, 10:22 AM
George Hughes
Download that
Jul 29, 2018, 10:22 AM
George Hughes
Yeah I'm tempted to Dow load thay

Ahh
Jul 29, 2018, 10:21 AM

It's so much faster
Jul 29, 2018, 10:21 AM
Fraser Macdonald
It's called messenger lite
Jul 29, 2018, 10:21 AM

Mine hasn't updated
Jul 29, 2018, 10:19 AM

Jul 28, 2018, 7:06 PM
George Hughes
Aye it's A‚ô≠
Jul 28, 2018, 7:06 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Is it a flat?
Jul 28, 2018, 7:04 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I can imagine aha
Jul 28, 2018, 7:04 PM
George Hughes
It's mad he's go so much music stuff in it
Jul 28, 2018, 7:04 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hm yeah
Jul 28, 2018, 7:04 PM
George Hughes
He's got a pretty sizeable room considering he's a student living in London
Jul 28, 2018, 7:04 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Hahah on the floor is fine
Jul 28, 2018, 7:03 PM
George Hughes
Not sure where you'll sleep tho :p
Jul 28, 2018, 7:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah that would be sick man
Jul 28, 2018, 7:02 PM
George Hughes
I went to see him in London the other week, you should come down next time I go
Jul 28, 2018, 7:02 PM
George Hughes
Can't remember what he got
Jul 28, 2018, 7:01 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Havnt really spoken to him much
Jul 28, 2018, 6:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Know what he got?
Jul 28, 2018, 6:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah true
Jul 28, 2018, 6:52 PM
George Hughes
And bear in mind he is like 5 years older
Jul 28, 2018, 6:19 PM
George Hughes
He sat it a couple years ago
Jul 28, 2018, 6:18 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Has he sat grade 8 yet?
Jul 28, 2018, 6:15 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Not sure about that
Jul 28, 2018, 6:15 PM
George Hughes
Toma has been playing 11 years and you're hot on his tail
Jul 28, 2018, 6:11 PM
George Hughes
Woww 6 six years is good
Jul 28, 2018, 6:10 PM
Fraser Macdonald
And I only mastered them to grade 8 level last yesr
Jul 28, 2018, 6:03 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Well I started learning them when I was in p4
Jul 28, 2018, 6:02 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Eh probably 6 years
Jul 28, 2018, 6:02 PM
George Hughes
Out of curiosity, how long did it take you to learn the scales to a reasonable standard?
Jul 28, 2018, 5:53 PM
George Hughes
That makes sense
Jul 28, 2018, 5:52 PM
George Hughes
Thanks so much
Jul 28, 2018, 5:52 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Then learn all the arpeggios
Jul 28, 2018, 5:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's the most straightforward way
Jul 28, 2018, 5:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Flat/sharp is irrelevant, but I would think of them as Bb Eb Ab Db F#
Jul 28, 2018, 5:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That way u are adding one more flat every time
Jul 28, 2018, 5:48 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Bb/A# Eb/D# Ab/G# Db/C# Gb/F#
üòçGeorge Hughes
Jul 28, 2018, 5:48 PM
George Hughes
Hmm?
Jul 28, 2018, 5:45 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Learn them in this order
Jul 28, 2018, 5:35 PM
George Hughes
But what next?
Jul 28, 2018, 5:34 PM
George Hughes
I've can do 4 octaves from the major scales of all white keys
Jul 28, 2018, 5:34 PM
George Hughes
Do you have any pointers on learning the scales of the flats?
Jul 28, 2018, 5:34 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Noice
Jul 28, 2018, 5:31 PM

Jul 28, 2018, 5:12 PM

That will be very useful actually

Fraser Macdonald
That's sweet
Jul 28, 2018, 4:09 PM

Oh cool
Jul 28, 2018, 4:09 PM
George Hughes
I plug my piano into it and it registers the notes played
Jul 28, 2018, 4:08 PM
George Hughes
I'm sure you'd play it with ease lol
Jul 28, 2018, 4:08 PM
George Hughes
But look at this fucking monstrosity
Jul 28, 2018, 4:08 PM
George Hughes
It works perfectly
Jul 28, 2018, 4:08 PM
George Hughes

Jul 28, 2018, 4:08 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Is it working?
Jul 28, 2018, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
And I made a program to help me learn piano
Jul 28, 2018, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
Sweet
Jul 28, 2018, 4:07 PM
George Hughes

Jul 28, 2018, 4:07 PM
Fraser Macdonald

Jul 28, 2018, 4:07 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah for sure man
Jul 28, 2018, 4:06 PM
George Hughes
We should play in person sometime
Jul 28, 2018, 4:06 PM
George Hughes
I'll say!
Jul 28, 2018, 4:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Best game yet
Jul 28, 2018, 4:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Thanks bro
Jul 28, 2018, 4:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That was the aim ahaha
Jul 28, 2018, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
It was beautiful
Jul 28, 2018, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
Thanks, you never left me any openings hahah
Jul 28, 2018, 4:05 PM
Fraser Macdonald
You are the first person I've played who I havnt taken a gamble on them not realising something, which says a lot

Fraser Macdonald
Cheers dude
May 15, 2018, 7:18 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Will do
May 15, 2018, 7:18 PM
George Hughes
Windows might be your best bet but I'll ask around, ask Toma what his macbook is like
May 15, 2018, 7:17 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah i would need it as a laptop
May 15, 2018, 7:17 PM
George Hughes
I can't recommend macbooks to you but I would say it might be an idea to get an actual Mac or just stick with windows
May 15, 2018, 7:17 PM
Fraser Macdonald
So what older model should I go for?
May 15, 2018, 7:17 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah
May 15, 2018, 7:17 PM
Fraser Macdonald
That's bullshit
May 15, 2018, 7:17 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Ahaha what
May 15, 2018, 7:17 PM
George Hughes
It's a joke, and one of the ports that you use to connect usb devices is also for charging
May 15, 2018, 7:16 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The fuxk
May 15, 2018, 7:15 PM
Fraser Macdonald
No usb
May 15, 2018, 7:15 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Yeah I heard about that
May 15, 2018, 7:15 PM
Fraser Macdonald
The laptop
May 15, 2018, 7:15 PM
Fraser Macdonald
It would be a macbook
May 15, 2018, 7:15 PM
George Hughes
Cause the ports are bullshit lol
May 15, 2018, 7:15 PM
Fraser Macdonald
What would u recommend then?
May 15, 2018, 7:15 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Really
May 15, 2018, 7:15 PM
George Hughes
You might be best getting an older model, everyone I've spoken to says they regret getting the new models
May 15, 2018, 7:15 PM
Fraser Macdonald
I'm gonna save up and buy one in 6th year
May 15, 2018, 7:14 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Nah can't afford one lol
May 15, 2018, 7:14 PM

Do you use a mac?
May 15, 2018, 7:10 PM
George Hughes

Fraser Macdonald
It is only 75
May 15, 2018, 7:09 PM
George Hughes
The interface might be overkill, the main thing for audio quality is microphone and the computer, (and headphones/speakers for listening back)
May 15, 2018, 7:08 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Not ordered it yet but it's looking to be about 200
May 15, 2018, 7:07 PM

Apr 26, 2016, 5:39 PM

Cause the exam is for theory, and in the actual sqa exam, they'll ask you to write code in any language you like
Apr 26, 2016, 5:39 PM

In the late twentieth century, two books cast their shadows over our futures. One was George Orwell‚Äôs 1949 novel ‚ÄúNineteen Eighty-Four‚Äù, with its brutal vision of a horrific, mind-controlling totalitarian state, thoughtcrime, Big Brother, Newspeak and the institute for torture known as the Ministry of Love. The other was Aldous Huxley‚Äôs ‚ÄúBrave New World‚Äù, which proposed a different and gentler form of dystopia. In Huxley‚Äôs capitalist dystopia, conformity is achieved through genetic modification and hypnotic persuasion, and endless consumption keeps the wheels of production grinding along. The state enforced promiscuity does away with sexual frustration, a genetic caste system, and ‚ÄúBliss‚Äù an endorphin with no side effects, makes everyone feel happy and included, and thus does away with the problems of mankind.

But Huxley didn‚Äôt stop there. He also gave his characters and objects famous names:
‚Ä¢ Herbert Bakunin: Mikhail Bakunin was a Russian anarchist revolutionary.
‚Ä¢ Bokanovsky's Process: Maurice Bokanovsky was a French bureaucrat.
‚Ä¢ Darwin Bonaparte: Charles Darwin came up with the Theory of Evolution. Napoleon Bonaparte was a French Leader.
‚Ä¢ Lenina Crowne: Vladimir Lenin was a Russian revolutionary communist.
‚Ä¢ Sarojini Engels: Friedrich Engels was a social theorist who helped Karl Marx write The Communist Manifesto. Sarojini Naidu was a freedom fighter in India in the first half of the 1900s.
‚Ä¢ The Malthusian Belt: Thomas Malthus was a British economist
‚Ä¢ Bernard Marx: Karl Marx is the famous "father of Communism"‚Äîhe believed the mistreated lower classes would rise up and throw off the yoke placed on them by the upper classes.
‚Ä¢ Primo Mellon: Miguel Primo de Rivera was a Spanish dictator
‚Ä¢ Polly Trotsky: Leon Trotsky was a Marxist Communist active in the early 20th century.
‚Ä¢ Helmholtz Watson: Hermann von Helmholtz was a famous German physicist.
‚Ä¢ Dr. Wells: H.G. Wells was a famous writer of science fiction novels.
This shows us that Aldous Huxley was well cultured and wanted to make his books and characters more interesting, usually with an ironic twist. Take Bernard Marx, Marx was a revolutionary but Bernard wants anything but revolution at the start of ‚ÄúBrave New World".

That sounds about right, u got any ideas?
Feb 20, 2016, 12:32 PM
Fraser Macdonald
Pop songs are Short - Keep it short. As a rule, your song should be approx. 3:30 in length. Airtime is very valuable and advertising (the way stations make money) is sold on the quality of the programming. Read, the quality of your songs. Every second you want from them better be hit quality. There are obviously exceptions to this rule, and there are many songs from established artists that are longer, but you are a new artist trying to break into a tough market.

Have you ever noticed that a DJ will talk over the song intro, or fade the song quickly before the end? That‚Äôs because they are probably trying to squeeze a four-minute song down closer to three. Most hit writers tend to agree, that a song without the intro or solo breaks should be 2:15 ‚Äì 2:30 so that when solos etc. are added by the recording artist, it doesn't exceed 3:30.

Ringing in my ears again someday?

I look up at the sun wonderin' if it shines on you,
Em
The world maybe dark,
G
But your light is shining through,

G C G
There maybe be mountains of fire and rivers of flame,
G D
If valleys surround there's no one to blame
G
I look up at the sun,
D Em
Wondering what is on your mind?
G Em
I'm thinking to myself why has life been so unkind?


G D
When, when will I see your smile
Em G D
And feel the warmth of basking in your ever lasting love
G D
Why, why don't you just give it up
C G D
To start again with someone far away


G C G
There maybe mountains between us with rivers so wide,
G D
When valleys surround us, there's no where to hide,

But your light is shining through,
