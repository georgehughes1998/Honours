somewhat, it boosts neutral stimuli more
Oct 27, 2019, 10:54 AM
George Hughes
If you don't fancy reading it, essentially while alcohol impairs emotional memories that are made while you're under the influence, it improves memories made (especially neutral memory) when consumed afterwards.
Oct 27, 2019, 10:53 AM
Callum Davies
So "drowning your sorrows" doesn't work as if you've just had a major emotional stimuli, pouring yourself a drink is likely to help you to remember that feeling?

Callum Davies
And depending on just how exactly you're measuring GDP, number 1 in the world is either the US or China
Oct 22, 2019, 2:06 PM
Callum Davies
I think North Korea's GDP is like 170th in the world or something
Oct 22, 2019, 2:05 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow there's magnitudes of difference
Oct 22, 2019, 2:05 PM
Callum Davies
The GDP of America is like $21.5 trillion I think
Oct 22, 2019, 2:04 PM
Callum Davies
I'd agree. Oh, so I looked this up a few mins ago, the GDP of North Korea is only $40bn. That's tiny compared to America

The US wouldn't do anything good with that information anyway
Oct 22, 2019, 2:01 PM
Callum Davies
That's true. So whilst it's true that China probably does have a lot of information about North Korea, they're not likely going to be sharing it with the US anytime soon
Oct 22, 2019, 2:00 PM
George Hughes
Well they're in a trade war at the moment
Oct 22, 2019, 1:59 PM
Callum Davies
Well, yes, but China are very much on North Korea's side. I know that if not an outright enemy, the US are certainly very wary about China right now
Oct 22, 2019, 1:59 PM
George Hughes
If anybody knows anything about Korea though, it'd be the Chinese
Oct 22, 2019, 1:57 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's true, it's an interesting war
Oct 22, 2019, 1:57 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that's possible. But Kim Jun Un is very good at keeping his circles close knit, as well as keeping North Korea a closed climate, information and immigration wise. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it would certainly be very difficult to get a spy into North Korea. Let alone into a position of power to gather the necessary intelligence
Oct 22, 2019, 1:56 PM
George Hughes
It's possible that there're spies within North Korea but the information is classified so we can't know about their findings
Oct 22, 2019, 1:54 PM
Callum Davies
Well, you'd think so. But they claim to have massive underground nuclear testing facilities, which wouldn't be able to be picked up with a drone, which is the only form of surveillance we have on North Korea at the moment.
Oct 22, 2019, 1:52 PM
George Hughes
Or a potential nuclear test
Oct 22, 2019, 1:51 PM
George Hughes
But surely we could detect a nuclear test?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:51 PM
George Hughes
I suppose yeah
Oct 22, 2019, 1:51 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that's the thing, isn't it? They claim they do, but they're so secretive that there's no way of actually knowing if those claims are true or not
Oct 22, 2019, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
I thought their weapons weren't properly tested
Oct 22, 2019, 1:49 PM
George Hughes
So the N Koreans actually pose a nuclear threat?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:49 PM
Callum Davies
It's the exact same tensions and promise of mutually assured destruction as with the US and Russia
Oct 22, 2019, 1:47 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, we essentially are. The US are in a cold war with North Korea in all but name at the moment
Oct 22, 2019, 1:47 PM
George Hughes
I don't really understand the scale though
Oct 22, 2019, 1:46 PM
George Hughes
We're basically in the middle of a cold war by that logic
Oct 22, 2019, 1:46 PM
Callum Davies
The largest gap between midnight was seventeen, which was in 1991. The year the cold war ended. So it started with the cold war, its closest was at the height of the cold war in 53 with 2 minutes, when the cold war ended the clock was set to the largest gap its ever had. And now we're right back to two again
Oct 22, 2019, 1:45 PM
George Hughes
But 2 minutes is still more than 30 seconds, which is more than 1 second
Oct 22, 2019, 1:43 PM
Callum Davies
And god, I hope not. Apparently the two factors considered for the doomsday clock is global warming and the likelihood of nuclear annihilation. When it hits midnight is literally the point it's been announced that Russia has just fired off 100 nukes or something like that. Midnight is certain imminent death
Oct 22, 2019, 1:43 PM
George Hughes
Ahhh I see
Oct 22, 2019, 1:41 PM
Callum Davies
Oh wow, apparently Stalin died in 1953, which I think led to the us and Russia having a nuclear arms race, and basically fighting over who had the most nukes. So no wonder it shifted to two minutes in 1953
Oct 22, 2019, 1:41 PM
George Hughes
Think it'll keep edging closer to midnight?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:39 PM
Callum Davies
The doomsday clock was most likely set up as a way of monitoring the cold war
üëçGeorge Hughes
Oct 22, 2019, 1:39 PM
George Hughes
Ahh okay, I never realised it was so close on the tail
Oct 22, 2019, 1:39 PM
Callum Davies
Started in 1947, so that can't be a coincidence
Oct 22, 2019, 1:38 PM
George Hughes
Take a look, you're more likely to be right
Oct 22, 2019, 1:38 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, was I too early? I thought the cold war was pretty much immediately after the second world war, and so I wasn't sure if 1953 was too late. But it would make sense. I'll look up some key years
Oct 22, 2019, 1:38 PM
George Hughes
Cold war would be a tad later maybe? I'm no historian though
Oct 22, 2019, 1:37 PM
Callum Davies
To my knowledge, it's never been closer than 2 minutes before. As I say, I believe the only other time since it was set up in 1947 it's been that close was in 1953, which would have been the cold war, right? Dunno if my dates are a little out
Oct 22, 2019, 1:36 PM
George Hughes
I dunno if I should laugh or not
Oct 22, 2019, 1:35 PM
Callum Davies
It's literally shifted from three to two minutes during trump's presidency üòÖ
Oct 22, 2019, 1:34 PM
George Hughes
Bloody hell that's a huge shift
Oct 22, 2019, 1:34 PM
Callum Davies
Scary stuff man
Oct 22, 2019, 1:33 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, and the idea is that it's symbolic, in which midnight is the Armageddon point. But like, in 1998 it was at 9 minutes. Within our lives, it's shifted that far
Oct 22, 2019, 1:33 PM
George Hughes
Ah good it's run by scientists
Oct 22, 2019, 1:31 PM
Callum Davies

George Hughes
Interesting idea, good for raising awareness
Oct 22, 2019, 1:31 PM
George Hughes
Ahhh okay so it's a general doomsday clock
Oct 22, 2019, 1:31 PM
Callum Davies
It was 2 and a half minutes in 2017, and the statement was given "In 2017, the Bulletin moved the time of the Doomsday Clock a half-minute closer to midnight, in part because of reckless approaches toward nuclear weapons and a growing disregard for the expertise needed to address today‚Äôs biggest challenges, most importantly climate change"
Oct 22, 2019, 1:30 PM
George Hughes
Deciding when to move them that is
Oct 22, 2019, 1:30 PM
George Hughes
Ahh okay, who is in charge of moving the hands?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:29 PM
Callum Davies
You can look at the timeline online. And there's always a press statement released alongside any shift detailing the reasons why. Ginmie a sec, I'll take a look
Oct 22, 2019, 1:28 PM
George Hughes
Why did it change last year and what was it before that?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:26 PM
Callum Davies
So this is quite a scary thought. Did you know that, as of right now, the doomsday clock is at 2 minutes to midnight. It moved there last year, the first time since 1953. We are literally on the brink of nuclear war

My question is why Rick is not the Rick yet the Morty is referred to as the Morty. Is it to do with the hour of the large cerebellum?
Oct 20, 2019, 5:07 PM

It's something to do with watching Rick and the Morty

It can't be any worse than the delay that it takes for someone to speak
Oct 14, 2019, 6:16 PM

Oh, almost certainly. If it can work with Netflix, I see no reason why it wouldn't with Amazon prime. There may be a slight delay issue, as whoever was hosting would be streaming said video to the other person, but it shouldn't be too bad, I hope
üò†George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:15 PM
George Hughes
It could probably work with amazon prime
Oct 14, 2019, 6:14 PM

Well yeah that sounds like a great idea, we could stick on some YouTube together sometime then
Oct 14, 2019, 6:14 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine, it's not about the game really, is it? It's just any excuse to hang out. On that point, as I say, there is a way I've found to just chat and watch YouTube if we want. It's called Kast, there is a browser option for Chrome, or a desktop program if you're so inclined. It does mean signing up for a new account on something, but it means we can watch YouTube, Netflix, anything we like together whilst just video calling and chatting at the same time. It's a video party/ movie night type programme. If it can read a video player, we may even be able to watch DVDs together haha

Oct 13, 2019, 3:42 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, okay then. How we gonna do voice chat? Because the in game chat will inevitably be a piece of shit, but we'll see. I'm just thinking if we have a call between us on discord but are also talking to people in the game, it could get very confusing. Also, unless we mute each other in the game, we'll get 2 sources of talking to each other, which would be very confusing

Haha, thank you. And I will remind you of one thing that I have learned, but I'm sure you already know. A lot of people think that differences, no matter how small, mean that it can't work. I'd disagree, because obviously massive differences could be a problem, but Katy's different to me in, say, music tastes, and she's actually introduced me to bands I've otherwise pigeon holed and not given a chance, like panic at the disco haha
Oct 13, 2019, 2:32 PM
George Hughes
Well I shall provide you with your dose of ego boost too by reminding you that Katy is lucky to have captured you all to herself üíÅüèº

Ooh, well I'm glad to hear that! Although, not surprised she asked you out, you're quite the catch! üòâ I don't blame her for wanting to bag you all for herself hehe. But it sounds like things went well.

We can dream, but I think that carries with it it's own problems. Plus, people would always make themselves private if they want to. You'd just find a market of (what would then be) illegal encryption software pop into existence. I think you should be allowed private information. It's a very complex issue that people far more eloquent than I have written about far more concisely

Oh yeah, I get that. That's what I'm saying, kind of.

I personally think it's a good thing. Because if it weren't for that sort of thing, information that should be made public couldn't be. Some information needs to be shared anonymously. It's like the Edward Snowden thing, if it weren't for the anonymity, we still wouldn't know today what the NSA were doing, which was a breach of our privacy

It's not all drug deals, you know. Many legitimate news organisations use deep web dropboxes to receive anonymous tip offs. Okay, not actually Dropbox itself, but the deep web equivalent of it. It's actually a really good way of keeping information free. Because sometimes there is information that needs to be made public, but the person can't release it without being known. It's actually how Edward snowden revealed the NSA documents

Callum Davies
Anyway, this is very inaccurate. .onion addresses are always random alphanumeric strings, aren't they? So a . onion address is more like lZs5s673Fzg.onion

But honestly, I can't thank you enough for giving me a place to stay. I know it was a big ask pretty much out of nowhere. It's been such a pleasure staying with you, and the amazing time I've had working for the underbelly would not have been possible without you. You, good sir, are a gentleman and a scholar.

Aug 20, 2019, 8:29 PM
Callum Davies
And jealous and of him being married? Again, not really, in a good way. Not really comparable. He's been with marzia for 8 years now, was 7 when he proposed, and god knows he has the money for a wedding. Plus he's almost 30, I'm barely 21. I've been dating Katy for 18 months. I don't have the money for a wedding at the moment
Aug 20, 2019, 8:27 PM
George Hughes
Lol as he's proved multiple times
Aug 20, 2019, 8:24 PM
Callum Davies
Of PewDiePie? With the best will in the world, not really. He's very likeable, and I can tell he loves what he does, but that lifestyle wouldn't be for me. And money doesn't necessarily mean happiness. More often than not it creates more problems than it solves
Aug 20, 2019, 8:24 PM

You jealous? :P

That's not a political statement in any way, just a shower thought on our usages of the word "intolerant'

Although ten years ago you couldn't have said that
Aug 19, 2019, 6:05 PM

George Hughes
Sometimes I get a slight discomfort from drinking milk, but I'm not lactose intolerant.
Aug 19, 2019, 6:05 PM
Callum Davies
Also, side note: lactose is one of the only intolerances that people are okay with you having.
Aug 19, 2019, 6:04 PM
Callum Davies
May I ask the reason for your going lacto free?
Aug 19, 2019, 6:04 PM
George Hughes
I used to love drinking milk back when I wasn't drinking lacto free
Aug 19, 2019, 6:03 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. I'm kinda craving a glass of milk anyway, so it'll get finished soon one way or another haha
Aug 19, 2019, 6:01 PM

I think it'd last another two bowls
Aug 19, 2019, 6:01 PM

Aug 19, 2019, 5:51 PM

Yeah, it's confusing. Co-op food is a business name, but a food co-operative is also the name given to a business structure. It's confusing.
Aug 19, 2019, 5:51 PM
George Hughes
And it's not technical untrue
Aug 19, 2019, 5:48 PM
George Hughes
Anything that's a part of the co-operative I refer to as a co-op because its easier to say
Aug 19, 2019, 5:48 PM
Callum Davies
So I may have misunderstood
Aug 19, 2019, 5:47 PM
Callum Davies
It is *A* co-operative, but it is not part of the company known as co-op. According to a very quick Google search.
Aug 19, 2019, 5:47 PM
George Hughes
Scotmid are part of the coop chain or something
Aug 19, 2019, 5:46 PM

You call it co-op, but the big sign says scotmid. Does the one own the other or something? I'm am confusion

Although, it's a fine line. I need to make it clear that it's just for business when I'm asking my female colleagues for their number. And I've not hidden the fact I have a girlfriend from other staff in conversation, and people talk. Don't want to end up getting an unfair reputation as a sleaze haha

It was even like, they were already giving me daggers, and were sitting at the back right next to the sound desk, so I felt really scared to radio FOH for backup, as it were. We don't have any sort of silent alarm in place yet. We have a technician's group chat on WhatsApp, but can't use that to contact FOH. technicians only.

Because it was going to be 2020, because the last scheduled election was in 2015. But then may called the snap election in 2017, so that pushed it back to 2022, due to the fixed term parliament act

Aug 14, 2019, 9:06 PM

I need to replace file destinations for a PowerPoint file. These are missing pathways to directories with unique files. Like his podcast, and personal videos! Until I am given the files, I cannot make it work!
Aug 14, 2019, 9:01 PM

Glad I could have you
Aug 12, 2019, 9:16 PM

I'm sure you would have found somewhere, but it's great to be able to flatshare with you! :D Always thought it would be fun to do that
Aug 12, 2019, 9:15 PM
Callum Davies
And obviously, thank you so much for all your hospitality, I honestly couldn't have had this amazing experience if it weren't for you
Aug 12, 2019, 9:15 PM

That's fine, that was my plan anyway. I just don't want to be heading home on the 28th because I'll be so shattered haha
Aug 12, 2019, 9:14 PM

;)
Aug 12, 2019, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
If you needed to stay longer, can always lock the back door and post the key through the letterbox on your way out
Aug 12, 2019, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
So if that works for you, then cool
Aug 12, 2019, 9:13 PM
George Hughes
I don't want to kick you out but there's probably not much reason for you to be there after then
Aug 12, 2019, 9:13 PM
Callum Davies
Hi there, so you're leaving on the 30th, right? The job ends on the late evening/ early morning of the 28th/29th. So I'll book my train ticket back home for the morning of the 29th, about 10 or 11am I reckon, and then I'll be out your hair for the 30th. The dates and times seemed to have aligned quite well
Aug 12, 2019, 8:30 PM

Enjoy your dinner!
Aug 12, 2019, 7:13 PM

Thank you very much, I'm having dinner with Katy ATM, but I'll message you on the train, or talk to you tomorrow. I'm getting on a out 10pm tonight

What? It's true. Jesus was king of the Jews, and Ben Shapiro is Jewish. Just pointing out those two facts

I can try sort out a plan for that this weekend if you like

Would it help if I let you some food for when you get home?

I'll see if I can nip out at the next break

You mustn't let yourself starve, it's worse than you think
Aug 8, 2019, 6:11 PM
George Hughes
I'm sure if you explain the situation to your superiors or a colleague, they won't mind you nipping away for ten minutes to grab something
Aug 8, 2019, 6:11 PM

I'm not, I'm just too busy working. Might have time about 11
Aug 8, 2019, 6:10 PM

Please, don't starve yourself
Aug 8, 2019, 6:09 PM

I'll probably not have time lol
Aug 8, 2019, 6:09 PM

Cause hunger does bad bad things to the brain
Aug 8, 2019, 6:08 PM

Aug 8, 2019, 6:08 PM

It won't bother me, and I doubt it'll bother Gabriel either since he's free
Aug 8, 2019, 6:07 PM
George Hughes
What time will you get back?
Aug 8, 2019, 6:06 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, also, how bad would it be for me to have a shower once I got in tonight? Or will I just wait until the morning?
Aug 8, 2019, 5:47 PM
Callum Davies
Nope haha. I got up late, so I didn't have time for breakfast. And my buses were back to back, so I couldn't nip into a shop during a stopover. As are the shows, so I don't know when I'm getting food lol
Aug 8, 2019, 5:46 PM
George Hughes
Have you had much to eat today?
Aug 8, 2019, 5:45 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry about it, you're all good in my books ‚ô•Ô∏è
Aug 8, 2019, 5:44 PM
Callum Davies
No, not that. I'm tired, hungry, and my girlfriend's currently in the hospital. So yeah, I'm not in the greatest mood at the moment, but that's neither or your fault, so I'm sorry
Aug 8, 2019, 5:43 PM
George Hughes
No I understand it's frustrating, but it's just an unfortunate clash that comes from living with other people
Aug 8, 2019, 5:42 PM
Callum Davies
Sorry, I'm tired and worried, I'm probably projecting. But yeah, I'll wash up when I get back
Aug 8, 2019, 5:41 PM
George Hughes
He told me just a moment ago, his exam was the next day though so important that he caught good sleep
Aug 8, 2019, 5:40 PM
Callum Davies
It's okay
Aug 8, 2019, 5:39 PM
Callum Davies
But if Gabriel complains I'm making noise in the kitchen like he did when I got in and had to end up eating cold beans
Aug 8, 2019, 5:38 PM

How's work?
Aug 8, 2019, 5:38 PM

Jul 30, 2019, 9:09 PM

Ah yes, my favourite
Jul 30, 2019, 9:08 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, time to call Vistaprint haha
Jul 30, 2019, 9:08 PM
George Hughes
Your career would maybe call for one at some point
Jul 30, 2019, 9:07 PM
Callum Davies
Don't actually have a card though haha
Jul 30, 2019, 8:55 PM

Apparently he had the Charlie Brooker seal of approval, so I'm looking forward to meeting him
Jul 30, 2019, 8:49 PM
George Hughes
Have fun dealing with that
Jul 30, 2019, 8:47 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, hopefully. We've got a comedian bloke doing his tech at 10, and hour has been allocated, but he's probably just gonna want a mic, we say "over there mate" out by 10:30, hopefully haha

Jul 30, 2019, 8:18 PM
George Hughes
I'll do that if I can't find anybody through word of mouth and chatting
Jul 30, 2019, 8:18 PM
Callum Davies
Oh? I'm sorry to hear that. Will you be okay? Not that I know of, but maybe put a message out on Facebook?
Jul 30, 2019, 8:17 PM
George Hughes
Know anyone who wants to live in Edinburger?
Jul 30, 2019, 8:16 PM
George Hughes
Also he has announced that he is moving out soon
Jul 30, 2019, 8:16 PM

Jul 30, 2019, 7:02 PM

Or not latching the door, rather
Jul 30, 2019, 7:02 PM

Haha, alright then. Would you mind latching the door tonight?
Jul 30, 2019, 7:02 PM

Gabriel is out of here next Wednesday so you'll get the room back :p
Jul 30, 2019, 6:53 PM

Callum Davies
Okay then, I'm definitely working at 8 haha
Jul 30, 2019, 5:59 PM

George Hughes
Awwh that might not work too well
Jul 30, 2019, 5:55 PM

Yeah, awesome, thanks. Bear in mind I'm not back till silly o'clock tonight?
Jul 30, 2019, 5:55 PM
George Hughes
This weekend, Gabriel and I are going to prepare some pork for dinner so we thought that if I ordered some tofu and some stuff to prepare it with, you might like to get in on the fun
Jul 30, 2019, 5:54 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, why?
Jul 30, 2019, 5:52 PM
George Hughes
Do you like tofu?
Jul 30, 2019, 5:51 PM
Callum Davies
It matches my phone calendar, so it's easier to compare
Jul 30, 2019, 5:49 PM

Jul 29, 2019, 7:32 PM

Hi there, George. Just wondering if you could wake me up when you wake up tomorrow? Cheers
Jul 28, 2019, 10:26 PM

Hopefully, I'm settling down now
Jul 28, 2019, 8:25 PM

I really appreciate you housing me, and further days should hopefully be a little better time wise. As far as I know, it's just these next few days
Jul 28, 2019, 8:17 PM
George Hughes
Good stuff
Jul 28, 2019, 8:15 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, thanks, I've seen that on Google maps haha
Jul 28, 2019, 8:02 PM
George Hughes
If you miss the last 44, you can get a bus to heriot watt and walk, but that's a last resort
Jul 28, 2019, 7:58 PM
George Hughes
I suppose I'll see you in the morning then
Jul 28, 2019, 7:53 PM
Callum Davies
It's fine, don't worry
Jul 28, 2019, 7:52 PM
George Hughes
Sorry I can't be more help
Jul 28, 2019, 7:51 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, I'll see what I can do
Jul 28, 2019, 7:51 PM
George Hughes
Cause there's fish in the cupboard
Jul 28, 2019, 7:51 PM
George Hughes
Can you be pescetarian?
Jul 28, 2019, 7:51 PM
George Hughes
Buses are pretty bad out here late at night, that's a bit of a pain that they've got you til 11
Jul 28, 2019, 7:50 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. I'll see if I can grab a pot noodle or something lol
Jul 28, 2019, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
Do you know how to cook lentils?
Jul 28, 2019, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
Awwh no its chicken
Jul 28, 2019, 7:49 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, veggie curry?
Jul 28, 2019, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
There's a curry in the fridge if you give me a pound ;)
Jul 28, 2019, 7:48 PM
Callum Davies
It's either buy food or catch my bus lol
Jul 28, 2019, 7:48 PM
Callum Davies
I honestly don't know what I'm going to do for food at this point
Jul 28, 2019, 7:48 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, okay then
Jul 28, 2019, 7:48 PM
George Hughes
He'll be here for two weeks then he's gone and the place is ours
Jul 28, 2019, 7:47 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then
Jul 28, 2019, 7:46 PM
George Hughes
Cause he likes to use the living room to study so you'll be using space that he usually uses.
Jul 28, 2019, 7:46 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine. And how come it'll cost more if I'm sleeping in the front room, by the way?
Jul 28, 2019, 7:46 PM
George Hughes
I didn't account for him being around though, sorry about that
Jul 28, 2019, 7:45 PM
George Hughes
In all fairness, it's his house too so I have to respect him. If I were him, I imagine I'd be a little uneasy about it at first too
Jul 28, 2019, 7:44 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that seems a tad unfair, if I'm being perfectly honest. It's not like I had any say in that being the case
Jul 28, 2019, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
He'll probably ask for more money knowing him ü§ë
Jul 28, 2019, 7:42 PM
George Hughes
I've texted him, I'll let you know what the deal is
Jul 28, 2019, 7:41 PM
Callum Davies
Well he'll kinda have to be, otherwise I'm on the streets haha üòÖ
Jul 28, 2019, 7:40 PM
George Hughes
It's all good, I'll need to make sure Gabriel is okay with the door being unlocked until you get in
Jul 28, 2019, 7:38 PM
Callum Davies
Sorry üòì
Jul 28, 2019, 7:38 PM

Jul 27, 2019, 9:14 AM

Bummer, do all the buses accept the Lothian app thing?
Jul 27, 2019, 9:14 AM

You don't need to scan it, you just show the driver the number on the screen
Jul 27, 2019, 9:14 AM
Callum Davies
My phone doesn't have NFC, but my card is contactless, so that's all good
Jul 27, 2019, 9:13 AM

It's exact change, they won't give you change back if you overpay
Jul 27, 2019, 9:13 AM

Ooh, okay then! Perfect! I can easily get cash, it's just a case of taking out a ¬£10 or something and buying a pack of gum
Jul 27, 2019, 9:13 AM

But I'm too tired to work anything out now to be honest lol
Jul 26, 2019, 9:51 PM

Jul 26, 2019, 9:45 PM

Or spend the day out in town
Jul 26, 2019, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
And on days where you're off, id leave the door unlocked and you'd just have to stay in.
Jul 26, 2019, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
If that were the case, that'd be ideal
Jul 26, 2019, 9:44 PM

But I'd probably be leaving the house at around the same time
Jul 26, 2019, 9:44 PM

Jul 26, 2019, 9:44 PM

No it's not my house so I can't do that
Jul 26, 2019, 9:44 PM

Aah, that's a good point. Is there a timpsons or something like that in town? If you get copies cut, I'll happily pay for them
Jul 26, 2019, 9:43 PM

And I'd need to lock up if we're both gonna be out the house

They make for good stories either way üíÅüèº
Jul 26, 2019, 9:42 PM

But you have no way of verifying the stories, so they could have happened?
Jul 26, 2019, 8:09 PM

Although I do take everything I read on Reddit with a pinch of salt, a good portion of it just people making shit up
Jul 26, 2019, 8:09 PM

And it's stuff like "How much chicken is in a 15-piece chicken box?" And "How much is a $20 fill up bucket cost?"
Jul 26, 2019, 7:57 PM

Jul 15, 2019, 6:34 PM
George Hughes
I'm of the belief that music is based on relativity and so changing A only has an effect on those with sensitivity to absolute frequencies of pitches, basically someone who has perfect pitch in concert pitch will dislike 432Hz more than someone who only hears music with intervals
Jul 15, 2019, 5:00 PM

That's an awkward situation but it's understandable
Jul 8, 2019, 5:11 PM
Callum Davies
I know, we've had this discussion. It's not permanent, it's just during the holidays when she doesn't have any SAAS. She really struggled to find any full time work in Perth, so she eventually ended up going back to her old job in Balfron. She's gonna find something part time for during college in September.
Jul 8, 2019, 5:10 PM
George Hughes
I mean she's paying for rent so it seems silly
Jul 8, 2019, 5:05 PM
George Hughes
What's the point in her working so far away and having a flat with you? Why doesn't she work in Perth?
Jul 8, 2019, 5:04 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but even when she's not, she'll have a shift the day after, so it's not worth the money her coming down to stay so short a time. Plus I'm not always available either. It just sucks that sometimes I won't see her for like 2 weeks
Jul 8, 2019, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
Does she work every weekday?
Jul 8, 2019, 4:58 PM

That's a shame you're not getting to see much of her
Jul 8, 2019, 4:57 PM

Whenever I put new strings on, I stretch them so they don't have to be played in
Jun 24, 2019, 8:35 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it's just kinda like they're pinging off other metallic bits of the guitar. Mainly the clamps on the head. I assume that's just because they're brand new and that'll go away as the stings become a little more flexible
Jun 24, 2019, 8:34 PM
George Hughes
Ping?
Jun 24, 2019, 8:33 PM
George Hughes
Hmmm
Jun 24, 2019, 8:33 PM

Well, the main one is that whenever I use the whammy bar the strings seem to "ping". Is that just because it's brand new, do I just need to break it in as it were

But try picking up duolingo or something cognitive to keep your brain occupied, and if your brain thinks it's doing something constructive, it won't have anything to complain about
Jun 17, 2019, 9:15 PM

If it keeps bothering you, I'm happy to chat about it more with you

Anyways, I'm certain you're worrying over nothing ;)
Jun 17, 2019, 9:06 PM

Yeah, but if it comes to it, it wouldn't be a permanent solution. Just to pay rent whilst I looked for a job in theatre
Jun 17, 2019, 9:05 PM
George Hughes
And don't be afraid to reach out to places, although you probably know that better than me already
Jun 17, 2019, 9:04 PM

There's no doubt you'll find somewhere
Jun 17, 2019, 9:03 PM

Careful when it comes to work like that, it's a bit of a rabbit hole. Make sure you do something that makes you happy
Jun 17, 2019, 9:03 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, I know. And I'm sure it'll be fine. And at the end of the day, I can always work in Primark or somewhere to pay rent until I find something better if I need to
Jun 17, 2019, 9:02 PM

So don'tchu worry
Jun 17, 2019, 9:01 PM

I'm sure your parents would be more than happy to help if you needed an extra leg, and you've got Katy there to support you too. At the end of the day, it'll work out somehow

Just as SAAS has ended, council tax will start to come in (I'm no longer a student) and although I've got a couple of things lined up, such as joining Joe Purdy Productions on the Dundee and Aberdeen legs of their tour and applying to the underbelly during the fringe, nothing is certain at the moment, and even if I do get them, certainly not permanent. I'm just a little worried about money at the moment is all. I mean, I do have my savings, but I want to try to avoid having to dip into those as much as I can
Jun 17, 2019, 8:58 PM
George Hughes
How so?

Is that the Rose Terrace in Michigan?
Apr 2, 2019, 2:02 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it'll be good
Apr 2, 2019, 2:01 PM
George Hughes
Ooooh congrats, I'll look forward to hearing about it!
Apr 2, 2019, 2:01 PM
Callum Davies
I can tell you all about it tonight
Apr 2, 2019, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
That's perfectly fine mate. But this will be the last time you're in this flat. We decided to go for the new place haha
Apr 2, 2019, 1:19 PM
George Hughes
Of course üòÅ I'd give you cash but I only brought enough for my bus fares üíÅüèº
Apr 2, 2019, 1:13 PM

Apr 2, 2019, 1:10 PM
George Hughes
Okay sure, lemme know if there's any trouble getting it
Apr 2, 2019, 1:10 PM
Callum Davies
There's an Asda on the way I think. I finish at 9, so I'll still be able to get one, I should think
Apr 2, 2019, 1:09 PM
George Hughes
I can see about getting one if you're not able to?
Apr 2, 2019, 1:08 PM
Callum Davies
Looking forward to our hanging out together. I'd pick up a six pack before, but I probably won't get to a shop before 10 lol. But if I can, want me to get one for tonight?

Apr 1, 2019, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. I'm happy to drop you back off in the morning, just be aware I do also need to make the trip to Balfron on the Wednesday, so I'm not sure how much of a lie in you'll be allowed haha
Apr 1, 2019, 6:54 PM
George Hughes
I'll take a sleeping bag and a camping mat
Apr 1, 2019, 6:53 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. And whenever you want. Feel free to crash if you want. An air mattress can be facilitated, if you provide one lol
Apr 1, 2019, 6:51 PM
George Hughes
What time will you want rid of me?
Apr 1, 2019, 6:51 PM
George Hughes
I'll come into town when Dad is taking Zo√´ in to taek wondo which is at 8
Apr 1, 2019, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
Eeh, it seems a little small to me. But the landlords are much better than our current agency, that much is clear from the get go
Apr 1, 2019, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
And yeah lemme just ask Dad
Apr 1, 2019, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Ooooh awesome, do you like it?
Apr 1, 2019, 6:48 PM
Callum Davies
So 8:00pm tomorrow at mine, yeah?
Apr 1, 2019, 6:45 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, it's with Katy and mum about what to do with the possible new flat. We viewed a place on rose terrace this morning, so discussions need to be had about what we want to do next haha
Apr 1, 2019, 6:44 PM
George Hughes
Don't tire yourself out too much!
Apr 1, 2019, 6:43 PM
Callum Davies
Sounds like a plan. I'd offer tonight but I have calls to make lol
Apr 1, 2019, 6:43 PM
George Hughes
Well sure let's catch up for a little while tomorrow evening
Apr 1, 2019, 6:42 PM
George Hughes
Goodness me!
Apr 1, 2019, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
As I say, super busy week haha
Apr 1, 2019, 5:56 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, it's no bother. Katy's away anyway, so imma be pretty bored haha. I'm in Dundee today and tomorrow, apart from the times I've just told you. Then I'm in Balfron Wednesday, and Thursday I need to be in Abernethy. Friday Saturday I've put aside for writing an essay anyway haha
Apr 1, 2019, 5:56 PM
George Hughes
We could meet up for an hour in the evening tomorrow if you like? But if you're busy I'll not take too much of your time
Apr 1, 2019, 5:54 PM
Callum Davies
I'm mostly in Dundee this week lol
Apr 1, 2019, 5:53 PM
Callum Davies
I'm free tomorrow morning, I'll have to rush off at 11, but I'm back at about 8pm tomorrow if you want. I am super busy
Apr 1, 2019, 5:52 PM
George Hughes
Just got back, I'm in Brig right now
Apr 1, 2019, 5:51 PM
Callum Davies
You're in Perth now?
Apr 1, 2019, 5:51 PM
George Hughes
No worries if you're busy üòÅ
Apr 1, 2019, 5:50 PM
George Hughes
I'll be going back to Ed on Friday probably
Apr 1, 2019, 5:50 PM
Callum Davies
I'll have to see. I've got a busy few days ahead of me. I'm not actually in Perth for most of this week haha. When are you here from and until?
Apr 1, 2019, 5:31 PM
George Hughes
I'm in Perth for the next few days, fancy meeting up at some point?
Apr 1, 2019, 5:26 PM

I'll be looking forward to hearing more Katy and Callum productions :D
Mar 29, 2019, 1:16 PM
George Hughes
That's a great mindset
Mar 29, 2019, 1:16 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, kinda. But also, I kinda wanna work out how it did it
Mar 29, 2019, 1:12 PM
George Hughes
You'll be petrified to touch it again in case it breaks :P
Mar 29, 2019, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies
Haha. And yeah, I found it quite difficult. I actually got it working by accident. I was just fiddling with it, and then it started working, and I wasn't actually sure what it was I did that got it working. But I just thought "eh, whatever it is I just did, that's got it working, so let's just roll with it" ü§£

Huh so they do, ASIO4ALL is actually really good but it can be a little pernickety to use
Mar 29, 2019, 12:56 PM
Callum Davies
Aah, I see. Makes sense. We use a behringer interface, and when I googled "behringer audio interface asio driver" it just pointed me towards ASIO4ALL anyway. Behringer don't seem to have an official driver for their interface, they just tell you to use the ASIO4ALL driver haha
Mar 29, 2019, 12:55 PM
George Hughes
Nah I use the my audio interface's own driver, it reduces latency like crazy
Mar 29, 2019, 12:53 PM
Callum Davies
Do you use the ASIO4ALL driver?
Mar 29, 2019, 12:52 PM
George Hughes
She'll be glad of the help :P
Mar 29, 2019, 12:51 PM

It's her mic
Mar 29, 2019, 12:51 PM

Damn autocorrect. I didn't mean to say my mic haha
Mar 29, 2019, 12:51 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that's all her, I literally just set up my mic and fixed any latency issues for her, she recorded and mixed and mastered it
Mar 29, 2019, 12:50 PM

Mar 26, 2019, 9:08 AM
George Hughes
That was a fun little project, thanks for the idea
Mar 25, 2019, 11:02 PM
George Hughes
I wrote this code to generate numbers based on the current time (the seed variable is redundant).

I then measured the occurrences of values that the generator generated and created above graphs using that data. You can see that the number of occurrences of all values are similar.

Mar 25, 2019, 10:28 PM
Callum Davies
It's not cheating, it's research...üò≥
Mar 25, 2019, 10:24 PM
Callum Davies
(Maybe see if you can find the code used for the random function in c and get some inspiration from that?)
Mar 25, 2019, 10:24 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, once you've got a functional RNG, I would think that code could be useful for all sorts of functions
Mar 25, 2019, 10:23 PM
George Hughes
I was just gonna try write a standalone random number generator but I can incorporate it into that :P
Mar 25, 2019, 10:22 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, fair enough. I would try to create a "random" number generator, then maybe use that to translate into how many letters to capitalise and where in the sentence to do so, maybe?
Mar 25, 2019, 10:21 PM
George Hughes
Cause you've challenged me to do it üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Mar 25, 2019, 10:19 PM
Callum Davies
Use whatever you like, but I think it's a big task, and if the good people who wrote c have already taken the time to write a "random" function so that you don't have to, why bother haha
Mar 25, 2019, 10:19 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, obviously a computer can never truly make anything random given there will always be an element of logic to its decision, but you know what I mean
Mar 25, 2019, 10:18 PM
George Hughes
Am I allowed to use the current time?
Mar 25, 2019, 10:18 PM
George Hughes
I dunno, lets find out
Mar 25, 2019, 10:18 PM
Callum Davies
No, don't do that. You'll die. It takes so much to program something that's seemingly random, doesn't it?
Mar 25, 2019, 10:18 PM
George Hughes
Even if it means an evening of procrastination
Mar 25, 2019, 10:17 PM
George Hughes
I accept your challenge
Mar 25, 2019, 10:17 PM
Callum Davies
Wait, there's a function in c for "random"? That's cheating! You gotta program "randomness" yourself haha
Mar 25, 2019, 10:16 PM
George Hughes
And for the record, the program does use currying üçõ
Mar 25, 2019, 10:15 PM

Feb 27, 2019, 3:48 PM

Oh that's awesome! Glad to hear it! Sorry I couldn't be of more help, I guess the code never turned up, I possibly accidentally threw it out :/
Feb 27, 2019, 3:47 PM

Hehe, but Katy and I are messing around with it tonight. Ooh, and if you'd like that system disk back, we've been offered a version of cubase LE 7 by my lecturer who has a spare copy he gave to me hehe. Not that your generosity goes unappreciated

Feb 13, 2019, 8:25 PM

I don't have a timetable for that day yet but it won't cause me any bother either way
Feb 13, 2019, 8:23 PM
Callum Davies
Hey buddy, so we finally got around to installing the cubase software onto Katy's laptop, and turns out that there is a code after all needed to activate the permanent software license. It's given us a trail license of the software at the moment, but I don't suppose you could think where the paperwork that came with the disk would be, do you? Because that'd have the code we need, I'm pretty sure. I'm assuming you'll not have redeemed the license key for this cubase, would you? Given this is your spare
Feb 13, 2019, 4:39 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, and by the way, it's the 19th November is when we're seeing the show, which is a Tuesday. So I'm not sure if that affects things or not

That's probably why it's so hectic üòÜüòÜ
Jan 18, 2019, 1:58 PM
Callum Davies
It's just a hectic production. But I suppose technically the director is in charge of that sort of stuff. But not like a big boss person, no. We all kinda just work together as equals
Jan 18, 2019, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
Do you have one person in charge of organisation?
Jan 18, 2019, 12:22 PM

Busy haha, very busy. But it's okay, if a little unorganised at times, admittedly
Jan 18, 2019, 7:37 AM

Full scale operation then! How do you find working with such big groups?
Jan 18, 2019, 12:14 AM

Ooh, so many. A cast fully of about 30, and a crew of probs 10/15
Jan 17, 2019, 11:59 PM

Do you pay for Spotify?

Admittedly it does feel like a long time ago, but then again spaget and Ugandan knuckles feel even further away ü§î

Maybe.. But I've got it in my head that it wasn't this year ü§î

No, surely not? E was definitely after spaget and Ugandan knuckles, surely?

Was it not last year?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:35 PM

E was a long long time ago
Nov 15, 2018, 11:35 PM

When was E? I feel like that might have been around June/July time?

I think that's exactly what he did

Was bike cuck January as well?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:27 PM
George Hughes
Ahh you might be right, need to get a meme calender for the whole year on my wall
Nov 15, 2018, 11:25 PM

'Ello! I've just been reliably informed by my colleagues that we don't actually finish classes until the 21st! üòÖ Doesn't stop us from doing evenings though, I suppose üíÅüèª
Nov 15, 2018, 10:26 PM
Callum Davies
That's gives us loads of wiggle room then, that's good. It'll be good to have you back. We'll need to arrange a gathering with Kyle as well üòä
Nov 15, 2018, 10:16 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. Hopefully I'll have caught up with all my work by then haha
Nov 15, 2018, 10:15 PM
George Hughes
Possibly earlier if I find myself with nothing to do here
Nov 15, 2018, 10:14 PM
George Hughes
Oh definitely üòé I don't know a date yet but I'm sure it'll be around the 18th
Nov 15, 2018, 10:14 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that'd be awesome. I've mentioned that to her, she's not entirely sure what day she's going down on yet. Do you know when you're in Brig from? Because of course you need to meet Katy, but I reckon a night just the two of us is also in order, eh? üòÖ
Nov 15, 2018, 10:12 PM
George Hughes
If she could stick around one more night, there's a gig at the Caley on the 22nd, we could go for a drink before that and meet/catch up before I play?
Nov 15, 2018, 10:08 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah! When are you heading down, because you've still to meet Katy! She's been dying to meet you; I have told her about you once or twice. Don't worry, all good things! As I say, she's going off to Stirling/Glasgow way for Christmas, but that's not till like 20th maybe, probably like 22nd/23rd, so hopefully we can align our dates! üòÖ
Nov 15, 2018, 10:07 PM
George Hughes
Awwh you too, and I miss you sometimes, but as I've told you before, I'll always be here for ya, no matter how long you don't message me for :P
Anyways I'm looking forward to spending Christmas with my family!
Nov 15, 2018, 10:05 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I know, you're a great friend. I felt really bad when I realised how much time I'd let pass without dropping you a message! üòÖ And I do try to visit home when I can, and I'm spending Christmas there, and Katy with her's
Nov 15, 2018, 10:01 PM
George Hughes
I'm sure you already do, but call your parents from time to time, they'll appreciate it more than you know :p
Nov 15, 2018, 10:00 PM

Nov 15, 2018, 9:52 PM

Ha ha, it still feels new! üòÖ It's kinda still weird to be living in Perth so close to everything
Nov 15, 2018, 9:27 PM

I'd love to!! It'll be great to see your new place, even tho it ain't that new anymore
Nov 15, 2018, 9:20 PM

Haha, yeah! You bet! Too busy! And yeah, pub sounds good. BUT, how about a pub in Perth, eh? You can stay round the new gaff for the night üòÅ

On the left, that's a speakon, right? It doesn't look like an XLR
Nov 7, 2018, 8:29 PM

Scarlett are good, simple but they do the trick. I know the college has a load of them
Nov 7, 2018, 8:20 PM

Oh, decent. Well, that'd be very cash money of you! üòÜ And Katy says that she's been looking at Scarlett interfaces ü§î
Nov 7, 2018, 8:14 PM
George Hughes
I got a spare cause I bought a new interface
Nov 7, 2018, 8:12 PM
George Hughes
I'll dig out the disc, but I'm not sure if it has a license key on it
Nov 7, 2018, 8:12 PM
George Hughes
Maybe a scarlett?
Nov 7, 2018, 8:11 PM
George Hughes
It doesn't, but there's plenty of affordable ones that do
Nov 7, 2018, 8:11 PM
Callum Davies
Does the lexicon alpha have phantom power capabilities?
Nov 7, 2018, 8:05 PM
Callum Davies
Stagg IMP-600 dynamic cardioid microphone. So no phantom power needed, right? But she says she might want to record her violin as well, which would need a condenser microphone (I recommend her a C-1 üòâ) so maybe worth getting a unit with phantom power anyway?
Nov 7, 2018, 8:03 PM
Callum Davies
Are you sure? That'd be awesome my man. Are you sure you wouldn't want some money for it, given licences do cost! Also, I can look online if she needs phantom power. She doesn't reckon she does, though
Nov 7, 2018, 7:58 PM
George Hughes
I might have a spare copy of cubase sitting around somewhere but you'll need to wait til Christmas for that as I won't be back in Perth :p
Nov 7, 2018, 7:55 PM
George Hughes
I bought the Lexicon Alpha, but depending on what mic she is going to use, you might want something with phantom power
Nov 7, 2018, 7:54 PM
Callum Davies
Hi George, we're looking into setting up a home recording studio of sorts for Katy to use on her course. I know you have a very effective setup that wields spectacular results (with a lot of talent, of course!) we're looking into cubase interfaces so that we can get the software bundled in "free" as well. I know that's how you got cubase, was just wondering which particular unit it was you got? Cheers üòâ

I feel like I get like 80% of it, but sometimes he just makes me go "what!?" Especially when he goes into the really theoretical and just purest mathematics. Although, I did feel like I was following him all the way in his video explaining how there are different sizes of infinities.

That's cool, I'll see about it. I'm actually up at Katy's for a wee while at the moment

I might do once everything has calmed down again üòÅ
Aug 4, 2018, 4:45 PM
Callum Davies
But you should get it. You can play with a controller, and hey, it's free! What have you got to lose? Plus, we could do duos
Aug 4, 2018, 3:31 PM

Well, if you have, we should totally play together. But I was meaning me, silly! Friend me if you want; the screen name is TouchySquirrel

Aug 2, 2018, 10:16 PM

I guess it is considered the Highlands
Aug 2, 2018, 10:16 PM

I dunno if you'd really consider Oban the Highlands üòÇ you might be right
Aug 2, 2018, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
I thought Oban was in the Highlands! üòÖ
Aug 2, 2018, 9:12 PM
George Hughes
We're not even in the Highlands, this part of the country is just a little disconnected üôÑ
Aug 2, 2018, 9:11 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. Makes sense for when you're up in the spotty connections of the Highlands
Aug 2, 2018, 9:09 PM
George Hughes
Plus doesn't have all the flashy bits and bobs
Aug 2, 2018, 9:08 PM
George Hughes
It saves data and it's able to send messages even with the worst connections
Aug 2, 2018, 9:08 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that's fine. I was just playing my turn because I hadn't played in a while. Why are you on messenger lite?
Aug 2, 2018, 9:06 PM

Can't play now cause messenger lite doesn't let you play games, I'll do it once I'm back from Oban

I guess, but at the same time, I kinda get where she's coming from. Cuz sometimes you do want to do something, but you can lose motivation. Especially at the gym. It really can help to have someone else to help you keep each other motivated
Jul 20, 2018, 7:26 PM
George Hughes
I hope it's not eggshells for ya :p

I feel like that's the difference between the two. Like, Katy's looking to lose a bit of weight, but she's told me she lacks motivation. So she's asked me to kinda force her to come to the gym with me, because she wants the push to actually get in there. I dunno, I'm not sure I'm making myself very well understood üòÜ

Jul 13, 2018, 11:00 PM
Callum Davies
Because right now all I know how to do is stream gameplay from my PS3 with live audio commentary over it, and not much else aside from that at the moment
Jul 13, 2018, 11:00 PM
Callum Davies
I'll also need to work out different configurations of my rig for different things; recording and streaming pc gameplay as well, getting audio from team chat, integrating face cam and on screen comments, little stuff like that
Jul 13, 2018, 10:59 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, there are certainly good and bad bits of the stream today! üòÖ And not on your life! üòÜ
Jul 13, 2018, 10:57 PM

You could just become a minecraft channel
Jul 13, 2018, 10:56 PM
Callum Davies
AHH, that may be a problem
Jul 13, 2018, 10:56 PM

I dont think you can change channel names until you reach a certain number of followers?

For sure, you gonna start a twitch?
Jul 13, 2018, 10:31 PM

Well, yeah, but it's also a skill, and I imagine I will get better as I do more streams

Yeah, it went alright. I would say about a 30% on the moist meter. Room for improvement, certainly, but an improvement on yesterday. The recordings on my channel if you'd like to peruse it's contents

On my way back up from the bus shelter (just to double check the bus times) a couple of edge lords shouted to me "You're gay!" I just shouted back "I know!" They had no response to that! The look on their faces! üòÜ They don't know what to do if someone agrees with them!

Oh so the plastic was resonating because the speaker, bass in particular, had enough power at the right frequency for said plastic grate?

Now, I realise that's caused by the speakers, but you know what I mean! üòÖ
Jul 10, 2018, 10:04 PM

Yeah, it's just like tiny little bits of buzz anyway. I don't think it was the speakers anyway, I think it was just the plastic grating in front of the cones vibrating slightly

Congrats on being able to accept and move forward with that! Best of luck moving forward :D
May 9, 2018, 8:34 PM

But if you've not used for months, sounds like that wouldn't be a problem for you. I was nearly every day, and then, tried doing stuff with Katy, and I looked it up, and was like "oh shit". So yeah, I realised I had a problem, decided to change, and I'm doing well, I think. Even though it's been such a short time, I know. And Katy's being so supportive about it! üòÖ
May 9, 2018, 8:33 PM
George Hughes
Thanks for telling me, I've read about that before and I can see why that would happen
May 9, 2018, 8:31 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then. Because, and I'll be honest, the only reason I know about this is because I've been experiencing it myself, there is such a thing as porn induced ED. And of course, excessive use of that, can lead to desensitisation, thus a lower sex drive for actual people. I only ask because I've been experiencing this as well. I stopped about a week ago, and don't plan to go back. I hope I'm okay telling you this. But if you genuinely believe that you are asexual, then I totally respect that. Good on you man, it's not easy coming out üòÖ
May 9, 2018, 8:27 PM
George Hughes
I used to watch a little, but not for months at a time usually lmao

May 9, 2018, 8:23 PM
George Hughes
Well it really doesn't matter what I am, but I don't feel inclined to actually fuck anyone despite admiring a good body when I see one
May 9, 2018, 8:23 PM
Callum Davies
But if it was a joke, that will have just risen tensions again
May 9, 2018, 8:22 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, I fully support you if that's serious
May 9, 2018, 8:22 PM
Callum Davies
Was that serious?
May 9, 2018, 8:22 PM
Callum Davies
Oh dear
May 9, 2018, 8:21 PM
George Hughes
Oh dear, I'm misogynistic for not liking oral with hair :/
May 9, 2018, 8:07 PM
Callum Davies
I don't wanna say it on the chat for fear of "triggering" them again, but okay if they don't agree with your opinion. I might not, necessarily. But it feels like they're not allowing you to have that opinion
May 9, 2018, 8:05 PM
George Hughes
I never heard you say that :P
May 9, 2018, 7:51 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, just saw the chat
May 9, 2018, 7:51 PM
Callum Davies
It is almost like people with a slightly different opinion is totally unacceptable to them. And I'd say Elliot should be okay to talk to. Why, has he messaged you?
May 9, 2018, 7:50 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, kinda. Just between you and I. Sometimes they do strike me as the archetypal Tumblr tot! üòÖ
May 9, 2018, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
But should I stay quiet?
May 9, 2018, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
I want to respond to Elliot..
May 9, 2018, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
No offense of course
May 9, 2018, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
I hate to say it but isn't that a little immature of them? :/
May 9, 2018, 7:47 PM
Callum Davies
In my experience with Jasper, that's sometimes the best thing. And don't worry, Jasper's sometimes a bit sensitive. I sometimes say something and they take offense to it, and I'm like sorry, and then in 2 hours time, they're saying sorry for overeating, and we're fine again. I'd just give them some space
May 9, 2018, 7:45 PM
George Hughes
Again, I'm sorry
May 9, 2018, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
I'll do that too then
May 9, 2018, 7:43 PM
Callum Davies
That's what I'm gonna do
May 9, 2018, 7:43 PM
Callum Davies
I wouldn't leave, rather just not message on there for a little while
May 9, 2018, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
You definitely have.
Maybe I should just leave the chat, but I feel like that's walking away from the problem
May 9, 2018, 7:41 PM
Callum Davies
?
May 9, 2018, 7:41 PM
Callum Davies
Have I? I feel like I have, but they're not seeming to get it. And I feel like you've explained very clearly as well. I think we maybe need to wait for the dust to settle!
May 9, 2018, 7:40 PM
George Hughes
Well you've explained yourself very clearly
May 9, 2018, 7:40 PM
Callum Davies
And I'm not blameless
May 9, 2018, 7:40 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, yeah. But we all make mistakes. I do think they're being kinda unfair here, not even giving us a chance to explain
May 9, 2018, 7:39 PM
George Hughes
This one is on me.. although I still don't understand what I've done.
I'm sorry for not thinking about who was in the chat when I made that joke and causing this conflict. :(
May 9, 2018, 7:38 PM
Callum Davies
I understand we may have messed up, but Jesus Christ, can they not give us a chance to be heard out! Why the witch hunt?
May 9, 2018, 7:38 PM
Callum Davies
Jesus Christ, I give up
May 9, 2018, 7:37 PM
George Hughes
I suppose
May 9, 2018, 7:30 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yeah, discuss it definitely. I just think making jokes during the discussion might not be the best idea for now
May 9, 2018, 7:29 PM
George Hughes
I hope
May 9, 2018, 7:29 PM
George Hughes
I guess, but I want to discuss it so that I can see their problem :/ maybe I'm wrong but I didn't hurt anyone
May 9, 2018, 7:28 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno, I'm feeling a bit out of my depth here. But you should maybe stop being so jovial, just for a few messages. Maybe a sincere apology is in order?
May 9, 2018, 7:27 PM
George Hughes
Fak have I messed up? I'm sorry if this causes conflict
May 9, 2018, 7:26 PM

May 8, 2018, 9:06 PM

May 8, 2018, 9:05 PM

It would be very unreasonable of me to blame you! üòÜ

Fuck, surely they had a deal with the charities?
May 8, 2018, 8:30 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it's a bit of a bugger. How's the charity taking it!? üò±
May 8, 2018, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
I'm discussing it now
May 8, 2018, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
So meh
May 8, 2018, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
But advertising and promotion are probably the most important parts of event management and they've made a hash of that :P
May 8, 2018, 8:29 PM
George Hughes
Most likely I won't hahah
May 8, 2018, 8:29 PM
Callum Davies
Aww, but how's that affecting you? Like, are you sure you'll still be able to play on this new date?
May 8, 2018, 8:28 PM
George Hughes
No idea when til tho
May 8, 2018, 8:27 PM
George Hughes
If I were you, I'd just change your plans, with the mess its been so far, I bet it'll end up getting held back
May 8, 2018, 8:27 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, I do really want to do this casino thing, but if it's not on, well then, let's not let down this person üòÖ
May 8, 2018, 8:26 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, is that for sure. Because Katy's friend was wanting to have a Eurovision and hang out party on the 12th, but we couldn't go because of that. So should I tell Katy that it might be a good idea to tell them the change of plans?
May 8, 2018, 8:26 PM
George Hughes
They might be postponing :|
May 8, 2018, 8:23 PM
Callum Davies
Well they've got two tickets sold! So provide them! üòÜ It's not your fault, I know. But it's a shame if we can't go, because we both really want to and looking forward to it üòÖ
May 8, 2018, 8:22 PM
George Hughes
They just replied, um they're struggling with ticket sales hahaha surprise surprise
May 8, 2018, 7:52 PM
George Hughes
Sorry haha
May 8, 2018, 7:51 PM
George Hughes
Hell I don't even know if any tickets have been printed off at all
May 8, 2018, 7:50 PM
George Hughes
The organiser of party box who is running the casino night on saturday never gave your tickets to Ben, but I've messaged asking if it's possible to pay at the door.. I don't blame you if you can't come though, the whole thing is horribly disorganised and I don't think whoever is in charge should be in charge at all

Awesome! I can't really remember exactly how much I've told you about Katy, but just wanna say that me and her aren't exactly a thing at the moment. Not like in a "Her!? God no!" Kinda way, just to avoid a potentially awkward moment. But who knows what'll happen? üíÅüèª
Mar 8, 2018, 4:47 PM

That's awesome :D We've invited a couple other folk to play so while they're doing their thing, we can catch up :)
Mar 8, 2018, 4:43 PM

Oh, the venue is owned by green room, maybe that was my mix up! I'll be in venue, then! üòÜ

Mar 3, 2018, 6:33 PM

Mar 3, 2018, 6:32 PM

Don't push yourself too hard, if you think you can manage it tomorrow, get some sleep and finish it then
Mar 3, 2018, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
No, when I say working into tomorrow, I mean I will still be working when tomorrow comes. I will be working all hours of the night. I will not sleep tonight
Mar 3, 2018, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
Well at least you've started it, tomorrow won't be so stressful
Mar 3, 2018, 6:30 PM

Still doing it mate. Probably gonna be working into tomorrow

Your name though? üòÇ
Mar 3, 2018, 6:27 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha ours did that last year as well, all the links I put for references were flagged üòÇ
Mar 3, 2018, 6:27 PM
Callum Davies
The plagiarism AI the college uses pulled me up for the url in my reference, which, you know, was used as a reference, I was literally saying myself that it wasn't my own words! and also pulled me up on the fact I quoted my name and student number on the document, because I wrote it!
Mar 3, 2018, 5:04 PM
George Hughes
They certainly do check things carefully, they pulled me up for plagiarism because they made a connection between a few things in my work, which was mildly infuriating because they just coincidences üôÑüòÇ
Mar 3, 2018, 5:01 PM
George Hughes
Yeah üòÜ
Mar 3, 2018, 5:00 PM

Aww, well. I mean, I wasn't genuinely suggesting that you use that: I feel like that would be pretty easy to spot! XD

Replace the first bit of your paragraph with "I've still got to draw 8 graphs, write about them and write a program which encrypts and decrypts information into images" and there's your answer üíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

I would give yourself 2 days for that, the research part will kill you before you get to the questions otherwise
Mar 2, 2018, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno. We were given like 3 weeks, but I reckon it can be bashed out in a day. It's like a research task, at the end of which we need to pose a report of 20 questions/problems to a hypothetical venue manager, as well as offering possible solutions to those problems
Mar 2, 2018, 3:50 PM

How much do you have to do for it?

Yeah. If I'm presented with a compelling enough argument, my mind can be changed. I'm actually pretty open minded nowadays üòÅ
Mar 1, 2018, 10:35 PM

Hah I just made you admit it's a funny meme üòÇ
Mar 1, 2018, 10:33 PM

Yeah, I guess it is üòÇ
Mar 1, 2018, 10:31 PM

Also the fact that it annoys so many people is actually pretty funny üòÇ

Fuck. I guess you're right. Damn! üòÖ
Mar 1, 2018, 10:28 PM

Just go anger people? Well then, its creator is a sadist then! üò†

George Hughes
That's pretty much the point of it I guess üòÇ
Mar 1, 2018, 10:16 PM
Callum Davies
It's just so, unnecessary. The meme makes no sense, it has no purpose. Which would be fine if it were a surreal meme, but no! It's trying to be a normie meme. It's just....üòì

Mar 1, 2018, 9:39 PM

Mate, you think the government is interested in this?
Mar 1, 2018, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Hahah true
Mar 1, 2018, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
Also the government are watching, so use a vpn so they can't seeee
Mar 1, 2018, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
As I say, I just tend to use it for LastWeek Tonight. And the drugs was a joke, obviously. The only drugs I get are less VPN more NHS XD
Mar 1, 2018, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
Not that I would ever do that ofc
Mar 1, 2018, 9:37 PM
George Hughes
But if you want full anonymity for buying drugs, use a vpn ;)
Mar 1, 2018, 9:37 PM
George Hughes
That is a good point, tbh I've never actually needed to use a proxy
Mar 1, 2018, 9:36 PM
Callum Davies
So do I, which is why I use a proxy as a get around! XD

Mar 1, 2018, 7:15 PM
Callum Davies
The new season in out! :D
Mar 1, 2018, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
It's for watching LastWeek Tonight with John Oliver on youtube. Which is crazy. They upload it to the site, right? So I'm not doing anything illegal by watching it. I use the totally legitimate youtube.com website to view it. But for some reason, they block it off in the UK. So i use that USA proxy to make youtube think my IP is coming in from america, so I can watch the thing they uploaded to the site!
Mar 1, 2018, 7:14 PM
George Hughes
Ooooh what do you need a proxy for? ü§îüòè

Well you're out of luck my friend, because I also like vegetables
Mar 1, 2018, 6:55 PM

Ahh, that's a good point. Maybe your stomach is like predator. You've got to stay completely still to avoid its attention. Its vision is based on movement! XD

And it rolls of the tongue
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM

Well it sounds like herbivore?
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM

Is furryvore a thing?
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
¬£40 a tyre isn't awful actually
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
Maybe that's too subtle tho
Mar 1, 2018, 6:45 PM
George Hughes
I think you missed a joke in the chat üòõ Furryvore ;)
Mar 1, 2018, 6:45 PM

I mean, my types are cheap in relation to other cars, but that's still about ¬£40 a tyre! üòÖ
Mar 1, 2018, 6:45 PM

Mar 1, 2018, 6:44 PM

But he's just abandoned the car
Mar 1, 2018, 6:44 PM

Yeah, I just recently got new tyres, so I don't want to be wearing them down spinning on the snow! I'm pretty sure that's what wore down my last set! üòÖ

The door is open anytime :) but aye, my flatmate sent me a video of a car outside trying to drive off, but the wheels are just spinning helplessly üòÇ I think it was an uber eats driver üòÇ
Mar 1, 2018, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, yeah. I might be in Edinburgh in early/mid march, I'm seeing friends there, but I'll see what I can do. Or I could always just come down some other time; I do have a car after all. Just when we can actually see the roads! üòÇ
Mar 1, 2018, 6:38 PM

Well when you do get the chance, we should do something less alcohol oriented üòÜ

Feb 28, 2018, 2:35 PM
Callum Davies
I've made it to Oban and Aberfeldy repeatedly in conditions like these, I drove to the doctor just today, I get up the flipping hill on the estate multiple times every day on days like this. And I've NEVER had to claim on the insurance! So many instances of driving perfectly in conditions like these, and people still say I can't drive in conditions like these. I'd agree with them, if not for the OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE!!!
Feb 28, 2018, 2:34 PM

I just talked to mum calmly and rationally about it. I said "I've been thinking about getting a tattoo, what do you think about it? I've been thinking about getting this, on the shoulder, but not anytime soon because it'll be quite expensive" and then mum suggested me getting it for my birthday

Glad your mum supports it, I know some folk who's parents would go crazy if their kid got one üôÑ

So kinda like all oxymorons are juxtapositions but not vice versa, where oxymorons would be the clashing of denotations of adjectives and nouns and juxtapositions would be a composition of words that denote clashing?
Feb 27, 2018, 7:33 PM
Callum Davies
Well, an oxymoron is more of a fundamental opposition whereas juxtaposition is more of pointing out a contrast between two things for poetic effect. So slightly different, I think, but on the whole, pretty much the same thing
Feb 27, 2018, 7:31 PM
George Hughes
What's the difference between the two? I think I meant oxymoron but I couldn't think of the word

Unless your Elvis where you have a big slapback right behind your vocal üòé
Feb 22, 2018, 10:52 AM
George Hughes
It's generally best ad a subtle effect üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è the idea of keeping the mix down is to make sure there's still plenty room left for other sounds
Feb 22, 2018, 10:52 AM
Callum Davies
Ohh, thanks. I'll try it out and impress everyone üòÅ
Feb 22, 2018, 10:51 AM
George Hughes
Ahh, basically you want to have the tempo about middle and the mix down to about 20% and it'll sound quite good on guitar solos or spacy vocals
Feb 22, 2018, 10:50 AM
Callum Davies
No, 3 tap delay. It literally delays it 3 times a second, or something like that. You play a note and it just goes "bum-bum-bum" it well, taps 3 times. I cannot work out what it's for, because I've heard audio it actually sounds good on! üòÇ
Feb 22, 2018, 10:48 AM
George Hughes
Tape delay?? üòÆ
Yes getting too reverb happy will sound awful üëåüèº
Feb 22, 2018, 10:47 AM
Callum Davies
Put a 3 tap delay on it. Sounds awful! Maybe too much reverb as well
Feb 22, 2018, 10:45 AM
George Hughes
And plenty of delay delay delay delay....
Feb 22, 2018, 10:45 AM

You've got to hand it to him tho, he's very good at campaigning üòÇüòÇ
Feb 14, 2018, 1:07 PM

I know right!? He's barely into his first term, and he's already planning the campaign for his second! üò©
Feb 14, 2018, 1:06 PM

Very presumptuous ü§î in fact if I didn't already hear about that, I would think you were joking üòÇ
Feb 14, 2018, 1:05 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I get that's a joke. But he's genuinely revealed his 2020 campaign motto already. He did it about 6 months after his inauguration. It's going to be "Keep America Great" üòë

As I say, time isn't the determining factor for how much you mean. That is a naive correlation to see üôÇ
That's great news, glad you're getting back on the right track üòÅ
Feb 14, 2018, 12:55 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. It just sucks that it took her such a short amount of time to get over it, you know? But hey, I'm eating healthily again, and beginning to exercise again
Feb 14, 2018, 12:53 PM
George Hughes
Then instead of pretending everything is okay, it actually will be okay
Feb 14, 2018, 12:52 PM
George Hughes
It's okay to be angry. But I think that anger is stemming from unhealthy beliefs, maybe you could use this to try understand what goes on in your head
Feb 14, 2018, 12:52 PM
Callum Davies
I know I am. But right now I feel like I need to be. I always look out for other people. And I always get hurt. I never let myself get angry or feel any sort of negative emotion. I always tried to be the bigger person. I mean, look! I try to clear things out with her, and the only reason she agrees is because she happens to be in Perth meeting this new fella! I'm sorry, but right now, I'm angry, and I'm letting myself be angry
Feb 14, 2018, 12:49 PM
George Hughes
If you truly love her, you'll know she needs to figure it out alone
Feb 14, 2018, 12:48 PM
George Hughes
Time isn't the determining factor of how much someone means.
There's the possibility that she needed a rebound to cope.
And even if she has healed quick, you surely must be happy for her if you truly love her. I hate to say it but you're being selfish :(
Feb 14, 2018, 12:47 PM
Callum Davies
Because why should I always have to be the one who tries to make things better? Aren't I allowed to feel hurt? And not because of that, but 2 weeks!? It's going to take MONTHS for me until I feel ready to get close to anyone like that again. 2 weeks!? Well at least now I know how much I meant to her
Feb 14, 2018, 12:44 PM
George Hughes
Are you saying she doesn't deserve closure because she met someone?
Feb 14, 2018, 12:43 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I'm feeling less like granting that kindness, put it that way
Feb 14, 2018, 12:42 PM
George Hughes
And now you don't want to clear the air because of him?
Feb 14, 2018, 12:41 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I asked her before I learned of this new guy. Because God forbid I should want to try to clear the air between us two!
Feb 14, 2018, 12:40 PM
George Hughes
What made you two decide to meet for a coffee?
Feb 14, 2018, 12:40 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. Barely 2 weeks since the break up. She's got a new "friend". Kinda difficult to be very chill about that little fact üòí
Feb 14, 2018, 12:39 PM
George Hughes
Just be chill about it üòÖ

Feb 11, 2018, 2:02 PM

Well basically this band that formed from Rockshop played at a nice venue called Bannerman's in Edinburgh. And they provide accommodation for touring bands.

So after they played, the next morning they woke up to spray paint all over the walls in the rooms they stayed in, and the bedding had been binned and other random shit.

So they did a runner and Bannerman's took to the internet to complain. It ended up all over the news and the kids have been getting death threats from hundreds of people online.
Feb 11, 2018, 2:01 PM
Callum Davies
Oh? üòÇ
Feb 11, 2018, 1:59 PM

George Hughes
See what she says I guess
Feb 10, 2018, 1:41 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that's totally understandable. Apparently Zoe's not doing too well either. And well, I guess the weird question is this; would it be weird if I were to have a coffee or something with Zo√´? Now, I know her and I do have a past, but don't worry, it's not anything like that! üò¨ I do genuinely just want to be there for her as a friend, somebody to talk to about it, you know? Obviously, I'm here for you as well, but I guess I'm just asking if you think it would be weird, of even helpful, if I were to do that.
Feb 10, 2018, 1:37 PM
George Hughes
Thanks for asking üòä I'm fine I think, but sometimes I worry about Mum
Feb 10, 2018, 1:34 PM
Callum Davies
Well, Mum just came up to my room and told me that she'd been talking to your mum, and apparently there's some stuff going on in your household at the moment. I hope you don't mind my knowing that, but why didn't you tell me that, man? Are you alright? You know I'm here you, man

Feb 8, 2018, 12:33 PM

There's C, C++, C#, F, F# and many many more

Just c? I've only ever heard of c++ üòÇ I know nothing!

Wait, it is python that the pi uses, isn't it?
Feb 8, 2018, 12:31 PM

Hahahah nope but that is along the lines of what I did last year üòÇ
Feb 8, 2018, 12:31 PM
Callum Davies
Because you used python?
Feb 8, 2018, 12:30 PM
George Hughes
That is true haha
Feb 8, 2018, 12:30 PM
George Hughes
But cause I used a system that I deemed more legible, they took off marks cause it wasn't exactly how they wanted it üôÑ
Feb 8, 2018, 12:30 PM

Nice. And you should. Plenty of people make a living selling source code

Feb 8, 2018, 9:43 AM
Callum Davies
Hmm üòï
Feb 8, 2018, 9:43 AM
George Hughes
It's okay to care about her, but you're attached to an idea, and that's not really her.
Feb 8, 2018, 9:43 AM
Callum Davies
üòï
Feb 8, 2018, 9:42 AM
Callum Davies
I get that. And I know I won't be able to let her go until I stop worrying about what she thinks about me, but that's really difficult because I do still care about her
Feb 8, 2018, 9:41 AM
George Hughes
But why can't you spend the rest of your life with her, romanticism is a strange perception: it means you love one person more than everyone else and that is odd, and it never works because we're human
Feb 8, 2018, 9:40 AM
Callum Davies
üòä I get that. But it's not really the same, is it? There's a difference between your friends and the person you want to spend the rest of your life with
Feb 8, 2018, 9:39 AM

Feb 8, 2018, 9:38 AM

Feb 8, 2018, 9:38 AM
George Hughes
I don't believe so, if you love someone, then you love them unconditionally
Feb 8, 2018, 9:37 AM
Callum Davies
Surely that's counterintuitive? Surely if you really love someone, you'll never be able to just be friends?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:37 AM
George Hughes
If you really love her, you'll love her as a friend
Feb 8, 2018, 9:36 AM
George Hughes
You can still be friends with them, but it'd maybe best if you met up with them when she's not there. And with time you'll be able to become friends with her again
Feb 8, 2018, 9:36 AM
Callum Davies
I can't cut her out my life without cutting Jasper, and by extension Kyle out as well. You see my predicament?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:34 AM
George Hughes
I think you need to let her go from your life and you'll get your answer about whether you she wants you in hers after you do that
Feb 8, 2018, 9:33 AM
George Hughes
Thing is, you're not going to be able to let go if you still worry about what she thinks of you, and by asking her questions like that, it's making it more difficult on you üòï
Feb 8, 2018, 9:33 AM
Callum Davies
I understand that thinking. Thank you. I almost want to say thank you to her! Because although we may be through, she still did give me some of the best and happiest times of my life
Feb 8, 2018, 9:31 AM
Callum Davies
Can I tell you what is really difficult?

I asked her a few days ago whether she genuinely wanted me to remain in her life, and she understandably said she didn't know and that she'd think about it. Not having an answer yet is killing me; but I obviously don't want to push her for an answer. But knowing her, she's just as likely fucking forgotten that I'd even asked her by now
Feb 8, 2018, 9:30 AM
George Hughes
Listen sometimes it's best to make a conscious decision to let her go, I know that sounds sad but you have to say to yourself if you want to get over her, you will
Feb 8, 2018, 9:29 AM
George Hughes
It's okay :)
Feb 8, 2018, 9:28 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah üòî I'm sorry for keep banging on about it

Well they should eat the things that their children biologically produce then dispose of them when they're no longer interesting
Feb 6, 2018, 3:12 PM

Basically, parents should eat their children. I think this is the conclusion we should draw from this

Feb 6, 2018, 2:11 PM
Callum Davies
Good luck üòÅ
Feb 6, 2018, 2:11 PM
George Hughes
Test tomorrow
Feb 6, 2018, 2:11 PM
George Hughes
Nahhh studying at home
Feb 6, 2018, 2:11 PM
Callum Davies
You?
Feb 6, 2018, 2:10 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah
Feb 6, 2018, 2:10 PM
George Hughes
You at college today?
Feb 6, 2018, 2:10 PM
Callum Davies
üòÇ
Feb 6, 2018, 2:09 PM
George Hughes
But I'll just tell ya, it's a piano keyboard üòÅ
Feb 6, 2018, 12:13 PM
George Hughes
One last clue, I ordered a full size one
Feb 6, 2018, 12:12 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I dunno
Feb 6, 2018, 12:11 PM
George Hughes
Well here's another clue, it has to be plugged in to be usedüòÆ
Feb 6, 2018, 12:09 PM
Callum Davies
Well, which one?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:08 PM
George Hughes
üòÇüòÇ
Feb 6, 2018, 12:08 PM
Callum Davies
It's either a drum or a dildo
Feb 6, 2018, 12:07 PM
George Hughes
Here's a clue, it's has hammer action to make it feel better üòÖ
Feb 6, 2018, 12:07 PM
Callum Davies
What is it then?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:05 PM
George Hughes
Haha jk nah it's not a mic üòÜ
Feb 6, 2018, 12:05 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I dropped the old one üôÑ
Feb 6, 2018, 12:05 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno. A new microphone?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:05 PM
George Hughes
Guess :p
Feb 6, 2018, 12:04 PM
Callum Davies
What?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:04 PM
George Hughes
Guess what I ordered
Feb 6, 2018, 12:04 PM
George Hughes
Not much apart from let yourself get back into a normal routine I guess
Feb 6, 2018, 12:03 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, still a bit shit. But what can you do?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:02 PM
George Hughes
Not baddd, you?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:01 PM
Callum Davies
How are you?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:00 PM
George Hughes
Hey
Feb 6, 2018, 12:00 PM
Callum Davies
Hi
Feb 6, 2018, 11:57 AM
George Hughes
Haha probably a silly thing to give thought anyway
Feb 5, 2018, 7:09 PM
Callum Davies
I never really gave it any thought, to be honest
Feb 5, 2018, 6:20 PM
George Hughes
See how oo makes an ew sound, is it just me that uses an odd number of o's to extend the oh sound and and even number of o's to extend the ew?
Feb 5, 2018, 6:08 PM
George Hughes
Heyooo
Feb 5, 2018, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies
Hi
Feb 5, 2018, 5:51 PM
Callum Davies
Will do
Feb 5, 2018, 5:08 PM
George Hughes
Send me some good ones üòÜ
Feb 5, 2018, 4:58 PM
Callum Davies
Sounds fun. I'll give it a try
Feb 5, 2018, 4:52 PM
George Hughes

Feb 5, 2018, 4:49 PM
George Hughes
There's an AI called Inspirobot who generated motivational images and quotes based on ones that people have made. Check it out, it's addictive üòÇ
Feb 5, 2018, 4:49 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough
Feb 5, 2018, 4:48 PM
George Hughes

Feb 5, 2018, 4:48 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I do. Thanks
Feb 5, 2018, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
If you know what I mean
Feb 5, 2018, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
I guess I also think don't "try" to do things inside your head, just let it be and it will sort itself out
Feb 5, 2018, 4:46 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. I'll try not to
Feb 5, 2018, 4:44 PM
George Hughes
I know sometimes I get caught in traps with feeling guilty and it's no use
Feb 5, 2018, 4:44 PM
George Hughes
But don't feel guilty for still feeling bad even when you remember how grateful you are, emotions are complicated
Feb 5, 2018, 4:44 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I should
Feb 5, 2018, 4:41 PM
George Hughes
I guess you write a bunch of sticky notes with all the things you're grateful for?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:41 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, yeah. I need to work on not doing that lol
Feb 5, 2018, 4:40 PM
George Hughes
It's easy to forget üôÑ
Feb 5, 2018, 4:40 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah üòä Sometimes I do forget just how lucky I am
Feb 5, 2018, 4:39 PM
George Hughes
You can have many loves in life üòòüòò
Feb 5, 2018, 4:39 PM
Callum Davies
I know that üòä Thank you so much
Feb 5, 2018, 4:38 PM
George Hughes
It's just cause part of our culture states that you must have a life partner to be happy. But that doesn't have to be true
Feb 5, 2018, 4:38 PM
George Hughes
But you're not alone
Feb 5, 2018, 4:38 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. I keep thinking how much later though. I don't like being alone
Feb 5, 2018, 4:36 PM
George Hughes
Well life works in weird ways, maybe there's lessons to be learned from this that will help you later on?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:36 PM
Callum Davies
There are times now when I'll look in the mirror and think to myself "Looking pretty good" but then my brain just goes to "Why didn't you have this confidence when you were with Julia? It's too late now, isn't it?"
Feb 5, 2018, 4:33 PM
George Hughes
Spend some time with your brother, your hatred of every little thing he does ought to adjust your focus ;)
Feb 5, 2018, 4:33 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I know. I really do try. I'm just finding it really difficult.
Feb 5, 2018, 4:32 PM
George Hughes
I think it's best you find something to occupy your mind, even if you don't feel motivated at first
Feb 5, 2018, 4:31 PM
George Hughes
Trying to stop thinking about someone will only make you think about them more
Feb 5, 2018, 4:30 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. Oh, Christ. I'm sorry. It still hurts so much. I should be doing work, but I just can't concentrate at the moment. I know it will stop eventually, but I still just miss her, so much. I'm really trying to progress, I promise üòî
Feb 5, 2018, 4:29 PM
George Hughes
But now all we have is some malnourished woodwind :(
Feb 5, 2018, 4:28 PM
George Hughes
Ahhh, sustenance
Feb 5, 2018, 4:27 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, memes
Feb 5, 2018, 4:27 PM
George Hughes

Feb 5, 2018, 4:26 PM
Callum Davies
You Vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
Feb 5, 2018, 4:26 PM
George Hughes
See thine puny school recorder to the left
Feb 5, 2018, 4:26 PM
George Hughes

Feb 5, 2018, 4:26 PM
Callum Davies
Okay
Feb 5, 2018, 4:25 PM
George Hughes
Let me find a picture
Feb 5, 2018, 4:25 PM
George Hughes
Oboe? Oh no. I promise you, the recorders back in the days were plentiful and very well fed
Feb 5, 2018, 4:25 PM
Callum Davies
Wasn't that called an oboe?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:23 PM
George Hughes
All we have now are embarrassingly little black tubes
Feb 5, 2018, 4:22 PM
George Hughes
The baroque period musicians had it right, they had giant mothrfucking monsters of recorders
Feb 5, 2018, 4:22 PM
George Hughes
See how they ran
Feb 5, 2018, 4:21 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough
Feb 5, 2018, 4:21 PM
George Hughes
And lo
Feb 5, 2018, 4:21 PM
George Hughes
You know on the third day, God created three blind mice.
Feb 5, 2018, 4:21 PM
George Hughes
So moving
Feb 5, 2018, 4:19 PM
George Hughes
So beautiful
Feb 5, 2018, 4:19 PM
George Hughes

Feb 5, 2018, 4:19 PM
George Hughes
???
Feb 5, 2018, 4:18 PM
George Hughes
Are you saying recorders aren't beautiful sounding instruments which allow us to speak the tongue of angels
Feb 5, 2018, 4:18 PM
Callum Davies
What?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:17 PM
George Hughes
You could express your sadness with a melancholy little melody on the recorder
Feb 5, 2018, 4:16 PM
Callum Davies
üòÇ
Feb 5, 2018, 4:15 PM
George Hughes
If only it were an acting course, you could express your rage through the medium of shouting angry things to a bunch of people without them thinking "wow he is very angry"
Feb 5, 2018, 4:14 PM
Callum Davies
I'm fucking stressed out to the max! And then Julia breaks up with me during all that!? Not great timing üòÇ
Feb 5, 2018, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
Hahah at least you're kept busy, nothing's worse than having nothing to do
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
Callum Davies
Too much
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
Ooo goodie
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM

Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM

Maybe not interesting but
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
Callum Davies
Lots
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
Got any interesting college coursework to do?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:11 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that's true
Feb 5, 2018, 4:10 PM
George Hughes
Trying to quantify your emotions is a little counter productive maybe?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
I know. But it's been over a week; surely I should be over her by now?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry about bothering me, I'm here to help
Feb 5, 2018, 4:03 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but I don't want to bother you too much with it all
Feb 5, 2018, 4:01 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry about that haha, it might help you to speak your mind to get it off your chest
Feb 5, 2018, 4:00 PM
Callum Davies
Hi, sorry for ignoring your messages. I was just feeling really shit again, and I didn't want to seem like I was ignoring your positive advice. I just didn't wanna dampen your positive advice with my negativity
Feb 5, 2018, 3:59 PM
George Hughes
Also I really love the Beatles
Feb 5, 2018, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
It's like you were saying earlier tho, that's my subjective view, but it helps me so I like to see it like that
Feb 5, 2018, 3:31 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah üòä
Feb 5, 2018, 3:30 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I get that
Feb 5, 2018, 3:30 PM
George Hughes
Make sense?
Feb 5, 2018, 3:30 PM
George Hughes
But he says when he finds himself in very dark times, it makes him realise that he can be free from suffering through those times by just being
Feb 5, 2018, 3:28 PM
George Hughes
I can't find the words to describe how I see it
Feb 5, 2018, 3:27 PM
George Hughes
It's taken on a negative meaning I think
Feb 5, 2018, 3:26 PM
George Hughes
It's not that meaning of the phrase
Feb 5, 2018, 3:25 PM
Callum Davies
I'm trying my hardest
Feb 5, 2018, 3:25 PM
Callum Davies
I know. But it's so difficult to let it be
Feb 5, 2018, 3:24 PM
George Hughes
Hey, listen to Let it Be by John Lennon, but listen closely to the lyrics
Feb 5, 2018, 3:23 PM

Feb 5, 2018, 2:20 PM
Callum Davies
I get that. Thank you so much. This has really helped. üòä
Feb 5, 2018, 2:13 PM
George Hughes
I believe that exactly
Feb 5, 2018, 2:12 PM
Callum Davies
This is true. And I suppose that whilst finding someone to share in the things you love is very nice, it's not necessarily needed in order to feel happiness
Feb 5, 2018, 2:11 PM
George Hughes
The desire to be loved can hide that love
Feb 5, 2018, 2:11 PM
George Hughes
We always have love, but sometimes it's hidden from us
Feb 5, 2018, 2:10 PM
George Hughes
Love is the joy of existence, of being, of sharing, it is the joy of understanding a good joke or performing a beautiful melody
Feb 5, 2018, 2:09 PM
George Hughes
Love and being loved are two very different things I believe.
Feb 5, 2018, 2:08 PM
Callum Davies
But surely love is the best thing in the world. It's the single greatest emotion one human being can cause another to feel. A life or a world without love is a very grim one indeed
Feb 5, 2018, 2:07 PM
George Hughes
On*
Feb 5, 2018, 2:06 PM
George Hughes
They care not who or what loves them, yet they live in
Feb 5, 2018, 2:06 PM
George Hughes
Imagine being a monk with no belongings and no belonging
Feb 5, 2018, 2:05 PM
George Hughes
It means we expect constant love and we get upset when we don't get it.
Feb 5, 2018, 2:05 PM
Callum Davies
Is that not a good thing?
Feb 5, 2018, 2:04 PM
George Hughes
There's a problem with western culture that I recently discovered, it's that we are told to respect everyone.
Feb 5, 2018, 2:02 PM
Callum Davies
I'll try to keep that in mind
Feb 5, 2018, 2:01 PM
Callum Davies
That makes a great load of sense.
Feb 5, 2018, 2:00 PM
George Hughes
But what they don't realise is that the love is inside themselves all along
Feb 5, 2018, 1:58 PM
George Hughes
People create gods so that they can feel loved
Feb 5, 2018, 1:58 PM
George Hughes
You know,
Feb 5, 2018, 1:58 PM
George Hughes
Ask yourself if other people's love towards you is more important to you than your own towards you
Feb 5, 2018, 1:57 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. She'd always tell me to have more confidence; but then she'd only ever let me know when I did something wrong; kinda difficult to feel loved in that situation. But I know I need to focus on myself
Feb 5, 2018, 1:55 PM
George Hughes
Think about that
Feb 5, 2018, 1:54 PM
George Hughes
How can you love others if you can't even love yourself?
Feb 5, 2018, 1:54 PM
George Hughes
I think that's where the problem lies then
Feb 5, 2018, 1:53 PM
Callum Davies
I know. But these things are far more easily said than done. I honestly don't care about myself at this point
Feb 5, 2018, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
Don't bother with what you mean to other people by the way, bother with what you mean to yourself
Feb 5, 2018, 1:52 PM
George Hughes
You always tell me that she doesn't share her feelings, so if it matters to you how long she takes to get over it, then remember she will most likely hide her grief
Feb 5, 2018, 1:51 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I think you're right. I guess it just sucks that she seemed to have gotten over it so much more quickly than me. Like I meant nothing to her
Feb 5, 2018, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
I think you were busy worrying about what you've done wrong when in fact there was no wrong done
Feb 5, 2018, 1:49 PM
George Hughes
It's always nice in the beginning, life is like that. But then the same things happen again, secrets are revealed that you may not like. With awareness comes problems.
Feb 5, 2018, 1:48 PM
George Hughes
I don't know how she felt
Feb 5, 2018, 1:47 PM
George Hughes
No I think she was a novelty to you, even if you don't realise it
Feb 5, 2018, 1:46 PM
Callum Davies
Glad to know I was just a novelty. She never actually loved me; I just wore off then wore her down üòî
Feb 5, 2018, 1:46 PM
Callum Davies
I suppose
Feb 5, 2018, 1:45 PM
George Hughes
An addiction is good at the start but it's no good for anymore after the novelty wears off
Feb 5, 2018, 1:45 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, it doesn't matter
Feb 5, 2018, 1:44 PM
Callum Davies
But it was so great. We just clicked. It was "good at the start" apparently, but then it "just ended up being like this all the time" so my only fault was that I dared to talk about my feelings?
Feb 5, 2018, 1:43 PM
George Hughes
Maybe it's not that either of you did wrong, but perhaps you're just not right for each other
Feb 5, 2018, 1:42 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. I'm just so confused about what it is I did wrong. She was giving me so many mixed messages
Feb 5, 2018, 1:41 PM
George Hughes
There's two sides to every coin eh
Feb 5, 2018, 1:40 PM
Callum Davies
I don't like having feelings
Feb 5, 2018, 1:39 PM
Callum Davies

üòÇüòÇ
Feb 5, 2018, 9:55 AM
Callum Davies
He didn't even mean to. "Okay, I can't paint like I used to be able to because my eyesight's going. Oh, what's that, you've created an entirely new art movement based on my slightly shifted art style that I literally needed to do? Sure, why not?"
Feb 5, 2018, 9:51 AM
George Hughes
üòÇüíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Feb 5, 2018, 9:49 AM
George Hughes
Huh good on Monet for being progressive
Feb 5, 2018, 9:48 AM
Callum Davies
You know Monet almost accidentally brought about the modernism movement because he was going blind. He could no longer paint in a realistic manner, and so through necessity his art style had to change
Feb 5, 2018, 9:46 AM
George Hughes
There's nowhere to go with it, apart from creating more ways to make art üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Feb 5, 2018, 9:43 AM
Callum Davies
But apparently we're now moving into post post modernism movement, which is a rejection of the principles of post modernism, which itself was a rejection of the principles of modernism, so surely that's just modernism?! üò¨
Feb 5, 2018, 9:42 AM
Callum Davies
This is true
Feb 5, 2018, 9:37 AM
George Hughes
I mean post modern art is inherently silly eh
Feb 5, 2018, 9:36 AM
Callum Davies
Fair enough
Feb 5, 2018, 9:36 AM
George Hughes
Silly is the highest form of art
Feb 5, 2018, 9:35 AM
Callum Davies
It's hardly high art. It's silly

Callum Davies
Fair enough. My one's just from parks and recreation üòú

Feb 5, 2018, 9:32 AM

Any reason why they were doing that?

Not really so much in tech theatre
Feb 5, 2018, 9:27 AM
George Hughes
A bit like music or art
Feb 5, 2018, 9:26 AM
George Hughes
You'll be able to one day if you work hard üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Theatre is all about sharing your personal interpretation isn't it?
Feb 5, 2018, 9:26 AM
Callum Davies
And anyway, that's only my personal interpretation of it
Feb 5, 2018, 9:17 AM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I'd love to; nobody would let me though! üòÇ
Feb 5, 2018, 9:16 AM
George Hughes
Being able to read into things like that is a good skill, and I imagine one that most successful directors and performers have
Feb 5, 2018, 9:15 AM
George Hughes
Why don't you direct it as an amateur production? You obviously understand it in more depth
Feb 5, 2018, 9:14 AM
Callum Davies
Well, there's almost always some production of earnest being put on somewhere or other. And yeah, I'd love to. It's just that not all productions of it are equal. It's a very silly play with a serious message. It often gets played far too seriously, in my opinion. Not enough directors realise that it's meant to be silly; it's a farce
Feb 5, 2018, 9:12 AM
George Hughes
If you ever hear of any of his plays being done in Perth or edinburger, fancy taking me out? üòé
Feb 5, 2018, 9:09 AM
Callum Davies
It's very good. I'd recommend his plays more than the book though. The importance of being earnest is better, in my opinion
Feb 5, 2018, 9:06 AM
George Hughes
Never read it üôÑ
Feb 5, 2018, 9:05 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, the picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
Feb 5, 2018, 9:03 AM
George Hughes
Does he cover it?
Feb 5, 2018, 9:03 AM
Callum Davies
I wanna see his opinion on Dorian Gray
Feb 5, 2018, 9:01 AM
George Hughes
I started reading that but I never got into it
Feb 5, 2018, 9:00 AM
Callum Davies
Fahrenheit 451 now
Feb 5, 2018, 9:00 AM
George Hughes
Yeah it's a good line isn't it
Feb 5, 2018, 8:59 AM
Callum Davies
"if I'd never seen such riches,
I could live with being poor" hmm, that really makes you think üòÅ
Feb 5, 2018, 8:57 AM
Callum Davies
Just on the brave new world bit
Feb 5, 2018, 8:56 AM
George Hughes
Yah that's how I came across him
Feb 5, 2018, 8:53 AM
Callum Davies
I think I might be watching the video you're talking about. Is it the PewDiePie book review video?
Feb 5, 2018, 8:49 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, of dog of wisdom lol
Feb 5, 2018, 8:43 AM

Still find the sound slightly annoying ;)
Feb 5, 2018, 8:38 AM

Yeah, that's a good wisdom
Feb 5, 2018, 8:38 AM
George Hughes
I'm off for a shower üòõ chat soon
Feb 5, 2018, 8:37 AM

There's a James lyric, "if I'd never seen such riches I could live with being poor"
It's not a particularly happy lyric but it's comforting to know that others hurt along side you üòä
Feb 5, 2018, 8:37 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it did. But seeing her again also made me remember what I've lost
Feb 5, 2018, 8:35 AM
George Hughes
It's cool, I was just a little curious to hear your opinion üôÇ
Aww, I hope seeing your friends at the party made you feel a little better
Feb 5, 2018, 8:35 AM
Callum Davies
I'll have a look at it soon. Sorry, currently feeling a little depressed. Yeah, still because of Julia üòï
Feb 5, 2018, 8:33 AM
George Hughes
Maybe I'm easily swayed but his arguments are compelling
Feb 5, 2018, 8:30 AM
George Hughes
Feb 5, 2018, 8:29 AM
George Hughes
I found this clip and I was intrigued
Feb 5, 2018, 8:28 AM
George Hughes
Thing is the way he argues it is very convincing because it makes complete sense.
Feb 5, 2018, 8:28 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I'm really not too sure about this guy, if I'm honest
Feb 5, 2018, 8:28 AM
George Hughes
Ugh those god damn liberals
Feb 5, 2018, 8:27 AM
George Hughes
üòÇüòÇ
Feb 5, 2018, 8:27 AM
Callum Davies
Fucking leftist cucks üòÇ
Feb 5, 2018, 8:27 AM
George Hughes
And of course by fighting for a right to not be offended
Feb 5, 2018, 8:26 AM
George Hughes
Politics
Feb 5, 2018, 8:26 AM
George Hughes
And he believes the left wing are actually causing much more harm than good by using identity politixs
Feb 5, 2018, 8:26 AM
Callum Davies
Hmm, that's a tricky one ü§î
Feb 5, 2018, 8:25 AM
George Hughes
But he doesn't agree with the use of "pronouns"
Feb 5, 2018, 8:25 AM
George Hughes
Well he's all for free speech, and he's all for freedom of sexuality, and quite rightly
Feb 5, 2018, 8:25 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, which way? For or against? üòÇ
Feb 5, 2018, 8:24 AM
George Hughes
No he's an author, but he's "controversial" because he's very opinionated about the lgbt and free speech debates.
Feb 5, 2018, 8:23 AM
Callum Davies
Never heard of him. Is he a musician?
Feb 5, 2018, 8:22 AM
George Hughes
What're your thoughts on Jordan Peterson?
Feb 5, 2018, 8:18 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah?
Feb 5, 2018, 8:16 AM
George Hughes
Can I get your thoughts on something?
Feb 4, 2018, 7:30 PM
George Hughes
I'm a little worried
Feb 2, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
He's using mine right now...

George Hughes

Callum Davies

Feb 2, 2018, 6:47 PM

George Hughes
Also, I'd love to meet and mingle with you and Kyle's college friends at some point üòÑ they sound like cool people
Feb 2, 2018, 6:44 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. Sounds like a great time üòâ
Feb 2, 2018, 6:38 PM
George Hughes
Oooh I'll add you to the list, try have a big party sometime üòé
Feb 2, 2018, 6:36 PM

Callum Davies
Not that kinda party, bruh
Feb 2, 2018, 6:24 PM
Callum Davies
But this is me! üòÇ
Feb 2, 2018, 6:23 PM
Callum Davies
Drinks? I might get a bottle of nice wine for later on in the evening, if I feel like it
Feb 2, 2018, 6:23 PM
George Hughes
Haha make sure you flaunt it, get free drinks from everyone :p
Feb 2, 2018, 6:21 PM
Callum Davies
Pretty much, yeah! üòÇ
Feb 2, 2018, 6:20 PM
George Hughes
Are you driving everyone there? ;)
Feb 2, 2018, 6:19 PM

George Hughes
Aw right, well hope the party is good craic
Feb 2, 2018, 4:50 PM
Callum Davies

George Hughes
I'll be in brig tomorrow afternoon, gig in the evening
Feb 2, 2018, 4:48 PM
Callum Davies
Okay. Sorry, really bored tonight. Seeing if anyone wants to hang out. Wanted to ask on the off chance you were in brig this weekend
Feb 2, 2018, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
Yah I am
Feb 2, 2018, 4:46 PM
Callum Davies
You're in Edinburgh, right?
Feb 2, 2018, 4:45 PM
George Hughes
Yeah of course
Feb 1, 2018, 9:18 PM
Callum Davies
Well, as much as I feel like
Feb 1, 2018, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
Have a lie in tomorrow :p
Feb 1, 2018, 9:13 PM
Callum Davies
Not really. Gonna catch up tonight lol
Feb 1, 2018, 9:12 PM
George Hughes
Did you catch any sleep?
Feb 1, 2018, 9:11 PM
Callum Davies
üòÇ
Feb 1, 2018, 9:11 PM
George Hughes
Oh boy my favourite
Feb 1, 2018, 9:10 PM
George Hughes
Work?
Feb 1, 2018, 9:10 PM
Callum Davies
Work, basically. Very exciting!
Feb 1, 2018, 9:10 PM
George Hughes
That's great! What have you been up to today?
Feb 1, 2018, 9:09 PM
Callum Davies
Good üòÅ
Feb 1, 2018, 9:09 PM
George Hughes
Hey, how you doing?
Feb 1, 2018, 9:09 PM
George Hughes
Good
Feb 1, 2018, 7:23 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I'll be fine
Feb 1, 2018, 7:23 AM
George Hughes
Ah, are you gonna be driving? hope you're awake enough to be safe :P
Feb 1, 2018, 7:23 AM
Callum Davies
Not much
Feb 1, 2018, 7:22 AM
George Hughes
I guess you didn't manage to get any sleep then?
Feb 1, 2018, 7:22 AM
Callum Davies
I feel shit
Feb 1, 2018, 7:22 AM
George Hughes
‚ù§Ô∏è
Feb 1, 2018, 4:11 AM
Callum Davies

Feb 1, 2018, 4:11 AM
George Hughes
That's fine, I hope your mind is a little more at ease :) Sleep well
Feb 1, 2018, 4:10 AM
Callum Davies
Imma try to get some sleep now, if that's okay
Feb 1, 2018, 4:10 AM
Callum Davies
Hmm. I guess I never thought about it that way
Feb 1, 2018, 4:08 AM
George Hughes
And I don't doubt there's others, so yes you are needed
Feb 1, 2018, 4:08 AM
George Hughes
From my view, I don't often need to fall back on people, but I find it comforting to know I always have friends who will support me if I fall, and I believe you would :P
Feb 1, 2018, 4:07 AM
Callum Davies
Well, yes. But need me to be there for them; I don't think so
Feb 1, 2018, 4:06 AM
George Hughes
It's a big fat yes ‚ô•
Feb 1, 2018, 4:06 AM
George Hughes
I can answer those :P
Feb 1, 2018, 4:05 AM
George Hughes
But read through those things.. aren't you loved by others? Aren't there people who need you to be there for them?
Feb 1, 2018, 4:05 AM
George Hughes
That's a good answer :)
Feb 1, 2018, 4:03 AM
Callum Davies
Is that the answer you were looking for? It's clich√© and deeply unhealthy, but it's how I feel
Feb 1, 2018, 4:03 AM
Callum Davies
Because she made me feel loved, and needed, and that whatever the hardships in my life, ie college work, it would all be worth it for the idea of building a future to spend with her.
Feb 1, 2018, 4:03 AM
George Hughes
Have a think, somewhere within you there's an answer
Feb 1, 2018, 4:02 AM
Callum Davies
So am I, to be honest
Feb 1, 2018, 4:01 AM
George Hughes
wondering*
Feb 1, 2018, 4:01 AM
George Hughes
No it's not right or wrong for it to be hard, I'm wonderig why?
Feb 1, 2018, 4:01 AM
Callum Davies
I know. It shouldn't be
Feb 1, 2018, 4:00 AM
George Hughes
Why is it so hard without her?
Feb 1, 2018, 4:00 AM
Callum Davies
You know why. I don't want to have to say it and sound clich√©
Feb 1, 2018, 3:58 AM
George Hughes
Go deeper, why do you feel like you hate your life right now?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:57 AM
Callum Davies
Because I hate my life! That's why! That's what it feels like!
Feb 1, 2018, 3:56 AM
George Hughes
Honestly it will help
Feb 1, 2018, 3:56 AM
George Hughes
And really consider the why, not just the idea of it
Feb 1, 2018, 3:56 AM
George Hughes
Try and look behind that and ask why it's telling you to do those things?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:56 AM
Callum Davies
My brain is NOT telling me to do very good things at the moment
Feb 1, 2018, 3:54 AM
George Hughes
Try and understand what your brain is trying to tell you
Feb 1, 2018, 3:53 AM
George Hughes
Well instead of trying to block them out, why don't you just sit and think for half an hour
Feb 1, 2018, 3:53 AM
Callum Davies
I can't fucking do that! I can't put thoughts to the side
Feb 1, 2018, 3:52 AM
George Hughes
Try meditation for a little while, just let everything be, don't even try to sleep, just be for a while
Feb 1, 2018, 3:51 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah üòï
Feb 1, 2018, 3:50 AM
George Hughes
Although I guess the insomnia isn't helping
Feb 1, 2018, 3:50 AM
George Hughes
You'll be better talking to her after a good night's sleep
Feb 1, 2018, 3:50 AM
Callum Davies
Plus I wanna fucking talk to Julia
Feb 1, 2018, 3:49 AM
Callum Davies
I've got maybe 2 hours until I can grab some food, and I'm starving. I've got no minutes left, limited data and nobody's up
Feb 1, 2018, 3:48 AM
George Hughes
Like trying to solve a thousand piece puzzle without looking at the pieces
Feb 1, 2018, 3:47 AM
George Hughes
No use trying to analyse it when it's in your head
Feb 1, 2018, 3:47 AM
George Hughes
Just write your stream of consciousness as it comes into your head, then analyse it
Feb 1, 2018, 3:47 AM
George Hughes
I find it useful to do mind vomit sometimes
Feb 1, 2018, 3:46 AM
Callum Davies
Meh, I dunno what they are to be honest
Feb 1, 2018, 3:45 AM
George Hughes
Wanna share any?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:45 AM
Callum Davies
Sorry, there's so many thoughts going through my head üòµ
Feb 1, 2018, 3:45 AM
George Hughes

Feb 1, 2018, 3:44 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah.
Feb 1, 2018, 3:44 AM
George Hughes
Much prefer countdown
Feb 1, 2018, 3:44 AM
George Hughes
It's a difficult show tho
Feb 1, 2018, 3:44 AM
Callum Davies
I dunno. I'm so-so
Feb 1, 2018, 3:43 AM
George Hughes
Huh, my mum is pretty good at it but I'm atrociously bad at seeing the pattern
Feb 1, 2018, 3:43 AM
Callum Davies
A little bit
Feb 1, 2018, 3:42 AM
George Hughes
Have you watched much of it?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:42 AM
Callum Davies
I know what it is
Feb 1, 2018, 3:42 AM
George Hughes
Watch it sometime, it's good
Feb 1, 2018, 3:42 AM
George Hughes
It's a tv show where you have to find the link between seemingly unrelated things
Feb 1, 2018, 3:41 AM
Callum Davies
Maybe üíÅüèª
Feb 1, 2018, 3:41 AM
George Hughes

I was meaning the D-Ream song "Things Can Only Get Better"; and band for which Professor Brian Cox was the keyboard player
Feb 1, 2018, 3:39 AM
George Hughes
Boom, maths has just solved your predicament ;)
Feb 1, 2018, 3:37 AM
George Hughes
Well if you want the maths, if you're feeling really low, there's not much lower to go so probability suggests improvement
Feb 1, 2018, 3:37 AM
Callum Davies
üòÇ
Feb 1, 2018, 3:36 AM
Callum Davies
Alright Brian Cox
Feb 1, 2018, 3:36 AM

Yeah. Life is good at the momentüòí
Feb 1, 2018, 3:35 AM
George Hughes
Ahh, can hardly blame you

Late as in the late Dent Arthur Dent. It's a sort of threat, you see. I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can be terribly effective
Jan 24, 2018, 1:15 PM
George Hughes
Pretty much üòÇ
Jan 24, 2018, 1:14 PM
Callum Davies
And you'll still be late! üòÇ

Jan 24, 2018, 1:13 PM

I'll probably wake up like 1ish üòÇ but I can get up a little earlier if you need
Jan 24, 2018, 1:13 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, the afternoon is what I'm thinking
Jan 24, 2018, 1:12 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha it'd be fun, depends when cause I'll be hungover af, and you'd need to pick me up from Edinburgh if you were doing that. But if that's all cool, then sure
Jan 24, 2018, 1:11 PM
Callum Davies
Plus free transport, mind you
Jan 24, 2018, 1:11 PM
Callum Davies
Also, ¬£25 an hour!? You're having a laugh right? I'll do ¬£10
Jan 24, 2018, 1:10 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but it's me who did it. I can't do it, because I can't play or sing lol. I'll still do my verse lol, because she actually likes that for some reason. I'll not stay for a while though. From what I hear, it's a pretty busy day for her that day. Always leave them wanting more üòâ
Jan 24, 2018, 1:10 PM
George Hughes
Ah I see what you did there
Jan 24, 2018, 1:09 PM

The 11th is Julia's birthday. She doesn't know I'm doing anything for her. I want to surprise her. She loved the song we made for her. We go up to Aberfeldy on the 11th. We drive up to her doorstep, or wherever she is üòÇ Live performance of the most romantic thing I've ever done for her!
Jan 24, 2018, 1:07 PM
George Hughes
Hahah well it's ¬£25 an hour I guess but transport on Sunday is tricky, what's your idea? üòÇ
Jan 24, 2018, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies
How much do you charge to be hired? I've got an idea!
Jan 24, 2018, 1:05 PM
George Hughes
Possibly, have mates coming over the night before for a mad one, how come?
Jan 24, 2018, 1:05 PM
Callum Davies
Are you free on the 11th Feb?

Just type "Louis CK" into YouTube. I couldn't recommend any one. They're all so good üòÅ
Jan 12, 2018, 9:48 PM
George Hughes
Got any clips?
Jan 12, 2018, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
He's very funny
Jan 12, 2018, 9:47 PM
George Hughes
I'm not too familiar with him to be honest
Jan 12, 2018, 9:47 PM
Callum Davies
He does deadpan very very well
Jan 12, 2018, 7:16 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. Like Louis C.K.
Jan 12, 2018, 7:16 PM
George Hughes
The best jokes are the ones that sound like they're told seriously a mon avis ;)
Jan 12, 2018, 7:14 PM

I kinda thought it was a joke, but I didn't want to assume lol. It's cool üòâ

Jan 12, 2018, 7:13 PM

Well I'm not the kind of person that would intrude on her meeting your fam, and the joke was if they're so cool, then why haven't I met them, maybe I worded it wrong
Jan 12, 2018, 7:13 PM
Callum Davies
Put a 'lol' or a laughing face or something. Else, how would I know? Think about it üòÅ
Jan 12, 2018, 7:12 PM
George Hughes
Too subtle eh?
Jan 12, 2018, 7:11 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. You didn't give any indication, so I didn't know
Jan 12, 2018, 7:11 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha I was kidding bro üòÜ
Jan 12, 2018, 7:11 PM
Callum Davies
She just wants to meet my family. She kinda like "your family is cool. I'd like to meet more of them" and not with Julia, no offense but you might kinda change the dynamic lol. And I'm kinda busy Sunday as well lol, so it looks unlikely. I feel really bad now
Jan 12, 2018, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
Can I meet them?
Jan 12, 2018, 7:08 PM
George Hughes
Fairs üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what's so cool about your cousin that she wants to meet them? ;)
Jan 12, 2018, 7:08 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, well we were going to go for dinner, but it turns out we're staying in now. Point is that Julia wants to meet my cousin, the venue doesn't really matter. Plus, it's a lot more chill this wayüòé
Jan 12, 2018, 7:07 PM
George Hughes
Where you going for dinner?
Jan 12, 2018, 7:06 PM
George Hughes

Oh, I've no delusions. I'm resigned to the fact that it's not happening this weekendüòÖ
Jan 12, 2018, 7:04 PM
George Hughes
Good luck getting anything done then üòÇ
Jan 12, 2018, 7:04 PM
Callum Davies
I was gonna and try to get some work done this weekend as well! That's not happening now üòÇ
Jan 12, 2018, 7:03 PM
George Hughes
Hahah you a playah
Jan 12, 2018, 7:03 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, meeting up with Julia for dinner with a cousin who's coming up from England. You're actually the second person who's asked me that today. I'm inexplicably popular this weekend üòÇ
Jan 12, 2018, 7:02 PM

You up to anything tomorrow morning?
Jan 12, 2018, 7:01 PM

No bother bro
Jan 12, 2018, 6:59 PM

Well you don't "need" to be, you just want to be for whatever reason üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Jan 12, 2018, 6:58 PM

Cheers for letting me know that he'd released a new work üòâ
Jan 12, 2018, 6:58 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that's just a reminder to myself when I open up my phone. I'm not that chill. So, I need to be more chill lol üòÇ
Jan 12, 2018, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
That background will help you be more chill ;)

Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I do but I couldn't remember if I'd mentioned the name
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Nor do I, but if he posts it usually catches my eye
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
It was actually you who introduced me to him. Don't you remember?
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Hahah
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
And yeah, I'm aware of his work. I just don't follow him religiously
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
On his Facebook page, think he has tapestries and prints on his website
Jan 12, 2018, 6:49 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. Is it on his website
Jan 12, 2018, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Simon Haiduk, you should follow him
Jan 12, 2018, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
The artist just posted it today
Jan 12, 2018, 6:49 PM
Callum Davies
It's beautiful. Is it a new one or something?
Jan 12, 2018, 6:48 PM

Cool new phone background if you want it

I usually am üòõ
Jan 11, 2018, 4:54 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. I know. You're probably right
Jan 11, 2018, 4:53 PM
George Hughes
It worked out fine last time :) don't let yourself worry
Jan 11, 2018, 4:53 PM
Callum Davies
Nah. It's just that Julia's going through some stuff at the moment, I think. But she won't tell me what, because she's kinda that type of person. She likes to sort stuff out by herself. So I'm giving her the space she needs at the moment, but I'm just worried is all, naturally
Jan 11, 2018, 4:52 PM
George Hughes
Want to chat about it?
Jan 11, 2018, 4:50 PM
Callum Davies
Lol
Jan 11, 2018, 4:50 PM
Callum Davies
Doesn't matter to you. Not your problem loo
Jan 11, 2018, 4:50 PM

What's up??
Jan 11, 2018, 4:49 PM
Callum Davies
Not too well, if I'm honest

Very bien dank√©, et toi?

...a ball of string, and 3 sticks of dynamite, officer
Jan 10, 2018, 4:17 PM
George Hughes
I have a theory as to why the police actually came though, and it involves a depressed debenhams employee
Jan 10, 2018, 4:16 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I see. Perhaps not then
Jan 10, 2018, 4:15 PM
George Hughes
Nah cause Edinburgh has laws that say no amplification, it's just that they haven't advertised them until recently
Jan 10, 2018, 4:15 PM
Callum Davies
That's ridiculous. Do it, if you do, demand that it be taken to a magistrate court. It's your legal right to be able to challenge fines. When you tell them what's up, any magistrate would dismiss the case
Jan 10, 2018, 4:14 PM
George Hughes
To be fair.. I think I was playing a little loud, but I didn't have my hearing aids in so I didn't notice lol
Jan 10, 2018, 4:14 PM
George Hughes
If I busk with an amp again, I get fined
Jan 10, 2018, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
I got a wee yellow note
Jan 10, 2018, 4:13 PM
Callum Davies
Ohh? Anti social behaviour!? üòÇ You didn't get an ASBO, did you?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
Folk dancing and singing along, coming up and thanking me, saying how nice a voice I have: "Anti-social behaviour"
Jan 10, 2018, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
"Anti-social behaviour"
Jan 10, 2018, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
It was about busking
Jan 10, 2018, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
Hahah nahhh I'm not doing that anymore
Jan 10, 2018, 4:12 PM
Callum Davies
Well, more specifically, illegal drugs üòÇ
Jan 10, 2018, 4:11 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, Christ! I didn't mean that! I wasn't thinking they were gonna come an make me disappear! üòÇ So what was it about? And you didn't have any drugs on you at the time, did you?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:11 PM
George Hughes
Fortunately we don't live in China so no :P
Jan 10, 2018, 4:10 PM
Callum Davies
Was it because someone you knew was driving with a headlight out?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:10 PM
George Hughes
Did I tell you I got spoken to by the police the other day?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:09 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, well we've put down a rag below it for the night, then we can work out what's going to need doing, if anything at all
Jan 10, 2018, 4:09 PM
George Hughes
ayyyy hahah although that's not good, will Scotty boy fix that for ya?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:08 PM

Plus, it's been dripping a liquid that we can't determine whether it's oil or just dirty water. Either I've got an oil leak, or just a dirty undercarriage. Like father, like son, eh? üòâ
Jan 10, 2018, 4:06 PM

Jan 10, 2018, 4:04 PM

I need it. I've been shouting at my car all day to GET THIS FUCKING HEADLIGHT OUT YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!!
Jan 10, 2018, 4:03 PM

Jan 10, 2018, 4:03 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, it's cool. It made me laugh
Jan 10, 2018, 4:03 PM

Hahah just couldn't resist *dropping* that one in

Turns out that refraining from letting it land on the floor makes it sound much clearer ;)
Jan 10, 2018, 4:01 PM
Callum Davies
Surely it's the exact same thing?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:00 PM
Callum Davies
Oh? Why's that?

It works much better than the old one did ;)

Callum Davies
Talking of, how's the new C-1?
Jan 10, 2018, 3:59 PM
George Hughes
I'll bear that in mind but I'll aim to make them see it as a favour to both parties and therefore no cost
Jan 10, 2018, 3:59 PM
Callum Davies
No, but seriously. Because my limit would probably be like ¬£200, absolute max!
Jan 10, 2018, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
Nah not a clue, I'll ask folk and see who's interested, I'm sure there's a few folk out there looking for ideas
Jan 10, 2018, 3:58 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, probably accurate
Jan 10, 2018, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
About 7, considering the students have to actually get out of bed to do any of the project :P
Jan 10, 2018, 3:58 PM
Callum Davies
And when we say money, how much are we talking? Like, triple figures? Oh god, not 4 figures? 5!? üòÆ
Jan 10, 2018, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
Hahah not a chance xD It's easy to finish a single person project in a couple days, but as soon as you start adding multiple students, it'll probably take quite some time to get anywhere hah

Could it be done my February 11th, do you think? I know it's a big ask, but that's her birthday lol üòÇ
Jan 10, 2018, 3:55 PM

Wouldn't rush into making presents even more difficult xD But I'll ask around and see if folk are interested
Jan 10, 2018, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
What if, we say they could use it for their portfolios?
Jan 10, 2018, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, I'll.see
Jan 10, 2018, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
Let's do it
Jan 10, 2018, 3:54 PM
George Hughes
Hahahah well I'll see but there'll probably be money in it this time xD Media students are very busy... although I'm sure you could sell the resulting organs on the black market to make up for it :D
Jan 10, 2018, 3:53 PM

Just horrific, horrific images

Callum Davies
You're fucking joking!? No way! That'd be crazy
Jan 10, 2018, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
I know a few people who could get a music video produced... that'd be a step up :P
Jan 10, 2018, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
Like, if any present I give her now is any less than an original song written about and for her, she'll be disappointedüòÇ
Jan 10, 2018, 3:51 PM
George Hughes
is that so? xD
Jan 10, 2018, 3:50 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, by the way, Julia says that I've now set a very high bar for myself
Jan 10, 2018, 3:50 PM

Awesome. But I feel like I'll be busy with work this weekend. But we'll see what happens
Jan 10, 2018, 3:50 PM

Jan 10, 2018, 3:47 PM

I noticed just before circus skills yesterday though, which starts at 7:15pm, so that meant I was driving in the dark yesterday with a headlight out! Was shitting myself üòÇ

Jan 10, 2018, 3:47 PM

I mean, I dunno. Anyway, took it to Scott (my mechanic; that's right, I have a guy) to help me fit it, because I've never done it on a yaris before and they have weird fittings, but it's all nice and road legal now
Jan 10, 2018, 3:46 PM

George Hughes
I'll sing to the stars oh
Wherever you are
I'll come to your doorstep
And stop for a while
Just to bask in your empathy
Share in our destiny
Look at the sky and
Forever we'll fly

Wait for a moment and
Spread our delight at the
Heavenly sights of the
North and the blades of the
Grass on the hills, the
Wind and the thrill of the
Hills and the marshes
Dividing the lakes

We stroll and we run through the
Blossoming trees and the
Birds and the bees will be
Humming today
And we say that we'll wait here
A million years while we
Share in our fears as we
Wonder our fate

I wandered further to
See what would lie there
And I stood amazed at the
Wonders I saw
But when you fall behind me
I trust that you'll understand
I'll be your helping hand
All will be braw

Every moment I'm breathing without you I'm
Broken and helpless through
All the next day when I
Think to behind when we
Smiled and we tried to make
Last all the time til I
Rode on my way

A venturous harlequin
Hair fiery red the
First time I met her
Doubt finally fled
She may never need me but
I'll always need her just
Singing how lucky I
Am to the birds
Jan 7, 2018, 10:54 PM

Dec 30, 2017, 10:37 PM

Thanks once again for all your help with the song. Julia's really interesting as to what our "project" (as I've been calling it) is; I can't wait to present it to her! üòÑ Again, enjoy your peronis, you've definitely earned them. I gave it a listen on the ol' cd player (because I still own one of those!) and it's sounding great.
Dec 30, 2017, 9:18 PM

Dec 28, 2017, 6:31 PM
Callum Davies

Dec 28, 2017, 6:31 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, or Christmas has just happened
Dec 28, 2017, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
We could go to the pub if I'm staying over?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:30 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I might do actually, that'd be fun
Dec 28, 2017, 6:30 PM
Callum Davies
You can stay over if you want. It'd be no trouble getting the air bed out. Since you're coming round tomorrow anyway. üòÇ
Dec 28, 2017, 6:28 PM
George Hughes
For sure bro
Dec 28, 2017, 6:27 PM
Callum Davies
Wanna hang out?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:27 PM
George Hughes
After dinner yeah üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Dec 28, 2017, 6:27 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck it. Are you free tonight?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:27 PM
Callum Davies
üòÇ
Dec 28, 2017, 6:26 PM
George Hughes
Same üòÜ I did need then tbf üòÇ
Dec 28, 2017, 6:25 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, yeah. And socks! üòÇ
Dec 28, 2017, 6:25 PM
George Hughes
Any socks?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:25 PM
Callum Davies
Nothing much, a few books, that sort of stuff
Dec 28, 2017, 6:24 PM
George Hughes
Either way, you'll know the answer üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è what did you get?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:24 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, if it happens! üòÇ I'm fully expecting her to just see it and ignore it. And yeah, I suppose.
Dec 28, 2017, 6:21 PM
George Hughes
Did you enjoy your Christmas btw??
Dec 28, 2017, 6:21 PM
George Hughes
It'll be good to hear it from her side :)
Dec 28, 2017, 6:20 PM
Callum Davies
I've sent Julia a message asking how she is and if she needs space or wants to talk. Because quite honestly I don't know what to do, so I just asked Julia.
Dec 28, 2017, 6:19 PM
George Hughes
Had any more advice? :p
Dec 28, 2017, 6:18 PM
Callum Davies
They're good.
Dec 28, 2017, 6:17 PM
George Hughes
How's Jasper? I still haven't met them
Dec 28, 2017, 6:17 PM
Callum Davies
Hi
Dec 28, 2017, 6:16 PM
George Hughes
Heyooo
Dec 28, 2017, 6:14 PM

Dec 28, 2017, 4:07 PM
Callum Davies
I won't. Thanks for the help, buddy üòä
Dec 28, 2017, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
And remember, don't worry ;)
Dec 28, 2017, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
Okieee chat soon then
Dec 28, 2017, 4:07 PM
Callum Davies
But I gotta go now. Jasper's messaging me. Speak soon?
Dec 28, 2017, 4:06 PM
George Hughes
Class üòÅ
Dec 28, 2017, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
But I'm still down for tomorrow hanging out
Dec 28, 2017, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
I suppose so. But for now, I think I'll give her space
Dec 28, 2017, 4:06 PM
George Hughes
It's easy to seem like the level headed one
Dec 28, 2017, 4:05 PM
Callum Davies
Really? She's always been the level headed one, to be honest
Dec 28, 2017, 4:04 PM
George Hughes
And listen, girls are more hormonal than guys, so anything she feels is going to be naturally amplified
Dec 28, 2017, 4:04 PM
Callum Davies
Maybe. Listen, I know I'm not blameless, but it did seem like a large reaction to what should have been just a little tiff, if that. Like, we've gone through a lot worse in the past
Dec 28, 2017, 4:04 PM
George Hughes
And the best thing to help her clear her head so she can see that it's not your burden is a little time
Dec 28, 2017, 4:03 PM
George Hughes
Maybe she just can't see that though
Dec 28, 2017, 4:03 PM
George Hughes
If that's so, then the disagreements she is having at home right now must be making it harder for her to accept help because she doesn't want to feel any worse?
Dec 28, 2017, 4:03 PM
Callum Davies
Yes. But I try to tell her, it's not burden whatsoever, and that I'd do far greater than that just to see her
Dec 28, 2017, 4:02 PM
George Hughes
So she's been brought up to fend for herself and now she feels extremely guilty accepting any help?
Dec 28, 2017, 4:02 PM
Callum Davies
Because of her parents. Basically, from what I can tell, basically all of her insecurities can be traced back to her parents. I dunno, maybe they taught her not to rely on anyone, but she's taken that to an extreme?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
Then you can look at the situation as Kyle might look at it, "objectively"
Dec 28, 2017, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
And writing your thoughts down will help you analyse them
Dec 28, 2017, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
But why is she so independent, there has to be an underlying reason
Dec 28, 2017, 3:57 PM
Callum Davies
It's not about going out. She loves going out. She's just fiercely independent.
Dec 28, 2017, 3:56 PM
George Hughes
I think you should write a story
Dec 28, 2017, 3:56 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, sorry, that was rude. I know you're just trying to help, and I appreciate that. I'm just quite emotionally volatile at the moment, and it's really difficult to talk about at the moment
Dec 28, 2017, 3:55 PM
George Hughes
But yes I'll stop now sorry
Dec 28, 2017, 3:55 PM
George Hughes
My bad, I'm just thinking if she has anxiety at all, she's refusing to let you give her a lift because she's worried about going out
Dec 28, 2017, 3:55 PM
Callum Davies
Can we please just stop talking about this?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno, do I?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:54 PM
George Hughes
Well during those meets, what is she like?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
Like once a month, if I'm lucky
Dec 28, 2017, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
She's always too fucking busy
Dec 28, 2017, 3:53 PM
George Hughes
You've seen her a few times though?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
üòÇüòÇüòÇ You think I see her at all?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
How does she act
Dec 28, 2017, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
I'm not talking about what she says, I'm talking about what you've observed
Dec 28, 2017, 3:52 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno. She doesn't tell me anything. I try to show an interest
Dec 28, 2017, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
Is she outgoing?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck me if I know? Maybe. It's not like she'd tell me if she does.
Dec 28, 2017, 3:51 PM
George Hughes
Or does she act the complete opposite?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:51 PM
George Hughes
Does she have anxiety at all?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
No, it's just the bus thing. She refuses to take help from anyone
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
She's not fallen out with anyone else there has she?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
Callum Davies
To Jasper's, for new year's
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
Haha
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
Are should I say
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
Where were you going to take her?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:49 PM
Callum Davies
But the buses won't run and she refuses to let me give her a lift, even though I told her it's no trouble whatsoever. She had it in her head that it's a burden on me, that's why we fell out
Dec 28, 2017, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
But the worst thing you can do is worry
Dec 28, 2017, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
If she wants to be there, she will be there
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
It's only special because of the people
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not doing anything! She wants to be there
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
All days are the same
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
What does it matter, it's worse to put pressure on her to be better by a certain date
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
New Years is just another day anyway
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
Callum Davies
In all likelihood
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
No?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, she's not coming for new year's
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry :)
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
Callum Davies
I'm giving her space though, trust me
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
Whether or not she actually needs it
Dec 28, 2017, 3:45 PM
Callum Davies
A few days!? New year's isn't that far away. We had plans üòû
Dec 28, 2017, 3:45 PM
George Hughes
She believes she needs alone time, right
Dec 28, 2017, 3:45 PM
George Hughes
Take your mind off her for a few days, she will message you when she's ready, and all will be well
Dec 28, 2017, 3:45 PM
George Hughes
If you want to know what would be best, try this
Dec 28, 2017, 3:44 PM
Callum Davies
I know, but at the same time, maybe some space will do her good. It's like I said to Kyle, sometimes people say they need alone time when they do, but something it's the worst possible thing they could do. So which one is this?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:44 PM
George Hughes
And you are a human, and you want to know everything even though it is trivial
Dec 28, 2017, 3:44 PM
Callum Davies
See the problem is that she never tells me anything, or ever does anything to put those worries to rest. And we've talked about this, her and I
Dec 28, 2017, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
She is a human, therefore she is blocking people out because she needs help
Dec 28, 2017, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
Think about this, humans are irrational stupid creatures that do things that don't make any sense
Dec 28, 2017, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
See the problem is that you worry
Dec 28, 2017, 3:42 PM
Callum Davies
Well, for one, I'm gonna be a barrel of laughs at new year's, aren't I?
üòÜGeorge Hughes
Dec 28, 2017, 3:42 PM
Callum Davies
And I want to help her. Like, at this point, I'm not sure if she even still considers me her boyfriend. Like, what if she never messages back?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:41 PM
George Hughes
It's difficult because you're anxious about what she thinks of you yeah?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:40 PM
Callum Davies
You're number 4. Cas, Jasper, Kyle, now you have given me that advice. My last message to her was a goodnight text yesterday. Who knows how long before she messages me again? üòû
Dec 28, 2017, 3:40 PM
Callum Davies
And I felt a bit out of my depth, so I kind of sought advice from some of her oldest and closest friends, and the consensus seems to be that I'd be best giving her some space. Which I'm currently doing, but I'm finding it difficult
Dec 28, 2017, 3:38 PM
George Hughes
From the sounds of it, she probably needs space to think. Some people share everything, and some share things when they're ready.
I imagine she doesn't know how to share her problems so it's easier to just shut everyone out
Dec 28, 2017, 3:38 PM
Callum Davies
She's no good at sharing what's going on, and I care so much about her, that's where the problems arise
Dec 28, 2017, 3:37 PM
Callum Davies
Like, she's been going through some stuff at home, I think. And she was acting weird and kinda pushing me away, which caused me to (I know, totally unreasonably) get a bit annoyed at her, and then she kind of blew up at me, and she's not really accepting my apology of any of my help, so now I'm just really worried about her/ that I've screwed things up and made things worse now
Dec 28, 2017, 3:36 PM
George Hughes
I'm happy to listen if you want to tell
Dec 28, 2017, 3:36 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that's the problem, sort of. Okay, it's a long story.
Dec 28, 2017, 3:34 PM
Callum Davies
(That's not sarcasm, by the way. I genuinely am complimenting your deductive reasoning)
Dec 28, 2017, 3:34 PM
George Hughes
Have you spoken to her about whatever it is?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:34 PM
Callum Davies
Bingo. Good brain üòÅ
Dec 28, 2017, 3:33 PM
George Hughes
:/
Dec 28, 2017, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
Is this Julia?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:32 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that really depends
Dec 28, 2017, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
Okay, hope you're feeling better soon :)
Dec 28, 2017, 3:32 PM
Callum Davies
No, it's fine.
Dec 28, 2017, 3:31 PM
George Hughes
You sure? Can chat about it if you want
Dec 28, 2017, 3:31 PM
Callum Davies
Never mind
Dec 28, 2017, 3:30 PM
George Hughes
What's on your mind?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:30 PM

Awesome. I'll let you two argue about who's going in the back! Or I'll just get the rope and tie one of you to the roof! üòÇ
Dec 20, 2017, 12:16 PM

Not a problem. May I just ask that either way, could you please let me know by about 3 or 4 pm today what's happening. Just so i know whether or not to pick you up.

*To it an hour early
Nov 22, 2017, 8:38 PM

Not at all. If anything I feel awkward dragging you too it an hour early
Nov 22, 2017, 8:37 PM
George Hughes
Sure. Thank you üòÅ Hope I'm not being too awkward
Nov 22, 2017, 8:36 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then. Well, I could drop the ticket off to your house tomorrow anyway, just in case. But I'd be happy to pick you up
Nov 22, 2017, 8:17 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I wouldn't mind, I have an exam that afternoon though, but I'll be back in time
Nov 22, 2017, 8:14 PM
Callum Davies
Well, as long as you're alright with being an hour.early. it starts at 7, but actors have to be there for 6
Nov 22, 2017, 8:10 PM
George Hughes
Cause you could probably just give it to me then? If that worked
Nov 22, 2017, 8:08 PM
George Hughes
That might be easiest, are you able to pick me up to take me to the show?
Nov 22, 2017, 8:08 PM
Callum Davies
Hi George, I've got your pantomime ticket now. Will I just drop it round to your mum, or?

Nov 15, 2017, 4:08 PM

Eww there are better ways to do that üòÇ
Nov 15, 2017, 4:08 PM

Nov 15, 2017, 4:07 PM

Haha about right üòÇ That's cool, I can imagine you would be enjoying it, right up your street üòÅ
Nov 15, 2017, 4:06 PM

Awesome! How's college life btw?
Nov 15, 2017, 4:03 PM

Like, it pretty much is boyfriend girlfriend type thing, we just don't wanna call it that yet. I'm seeing her on Friday, so that's something to look forward to
Nov 15, 2017, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
Sick moves dude
Nov 15, 2017, 3:56 PM
Callum Davies
Well yes. And she's obviously interested in me. Otherwise we wouldn't have spent all night kissing and cuddling the night we met üòè
Nov 15, 2017, 3:56 PM
George Hughes
Well you're obviously interested in this girl üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Nov 15, 2017, 3:55 PM

George Hughes
If you want it, go for it bruh üòÅ
Nov 15, 2017, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, met her through a mutual friend a few days ago. And we really seem to be clicking, but we're hesitant to put any labels on it yet. It is whatever it is, but at the moment, it seems good. üòâ
Nov 15, 2017, 3:53 PM
George Hughes
Friend?? Oooh!üòè
Nov 15, 2017, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
I don't think so. Well, you know my mum, and she's going to be in it! The only other people I'm buying tickets for are Ben (friend from college) and Julia (erm...friend?) üòÇ
Nov 15, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
Yeah skippinish üòõ mum booked tickets. I'd hate to be awkward though, is anyone else I know going to see it?
Nov 15, 2017, 3:45 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then. If needs be, I could maybe give you a lift
Nov 15, 2017, 2:43 PM
Callum Davies
Saturday is our last performance this year, but you're seeing skippinache then, aren't you?
Nov 15, 2017, 2:43 PM
George Hughes
Haha fairs üôÑ listen I really want to make it so get me a ticket and I'll see what I can do
Nov 15, 2017, 2:43 PM
Callum Davies
I'm guessing roughly once a year! üòÇ It's a pantomime.
Nov 15, 2017, 2:42 PM
George Hughes
How often will you do a show like this?
Nov 15, 2017, 2:42 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, well tickets are on sale to general public now, so should I not get you a ticket this evening? Bear in mind that they might be sold out by the time Sunday comes around
Nov 15, 2017, 2:41 PM
George Hughes
But I'll check bus times later
Nov 15, 2017, 2:37 PM
George Hughes
So I'd be cutting it fine for getting back to Perth in time
Nov 15, 2017, 2:37 PM
George Hughes
Turns out I have an exam on that Friday
Nov 15, 2017, 2:36 PM

Don't worry, I've got it. Friday, right? I'll try to buy your ticket today and get it to you soon.
Nov 15, 2017, 2:23 PM
Callum Davies
Hey man, could you remind me what date you wanted the pantomime ticket for?
Nov 15, 2017, 2:16 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine
Sep 29, 2017, 1:48 PM
George Hughes
Euan might be here by then so he'll probs come to the station as well
Sep 29, 2017, 1:31 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's an idea
Sep 29, 2017, 1:28 PM
Callum Davies
Would you be cool if I meet the guy at the station as well, and we all go together? Remember I'm coming in about 6:10, all being well

Oh right yeah you've shown me his videos! That's pretty cool!
Sep 29, 2017, 1:11 PM
Callum Davies
He also makes adventure games as well
Sep 29, 2017, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it reads like there's heavy hitchhiker's and disk world influences. In fact, he cites Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett as some of his main influences. It's very funny üòÅ I don't know if you've ever watched Zero Punctuation on YouTube; it's the same guy. His actual name is Benjamin, but he goes by Yahtzee. God knows why
Sep 29, 2017, 1:06 PM

Sounds sort of like ironic humour, but if hitchhikers influence in there maybe?

I don't own it. Plus, college is really hectic right now; fresher's, making new friends, meeting up with them, meeting up with old friends, doing the actual course. For example, tomorrow I'm both working on the car for a good few hours, then helping a new college friend move in during the evening. Would it be cool if we waited until the hustle and bustle of starting college dies down?

Wubalubadubdub! New episode tonight! Well, tomorrow for me. I know they air @ 11:30pm over in America, which is like 3:30 in the morning for us. I'd be willing to stay up till 11:30 for it, but not 3:30! I just tend to either catch them the next day on YouTube before they get taken down, or catch them on watch cartoons online

Hiya, just a quick wee update. Mum says it's fine for you coming round, you can stay over, but just bear in mind that she has little ones in the morning as well. (From about 8am) And I said I'd walk the dog today, so would you mind if when we get back to mine, we take the dog out for a wee walk, then we'll be free to do whatever
Aug 15, 2017, 1:12 PM

I'll talk to mum about it. To save fiddling around with air beds, I do have a double bed, if you're okay with that?

I can see about getting a lift back, or if it's not too awkward, stay at yours?

Also, you ended up paying 2 rounds to my 1 last time. So first one tonight's on me
Aug 15, 2017, 12:57 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, I should probably mention, mum's working today, so until about 6 we'll just need to be away in my room. And sure, but how are you getting back then? Because if I'm drinking, I'll not be good to drive. And I really didn't feel too good after last time, I don't know why. I'm usually so good at handling my alcohol. I might just have one or two standard strength beers, if it's all the same to you
Aug 15, 2017, 12:57 PM
George Hughes
Sure that's fine
Aug 15, 2017, 12:55 PM

Aug 15, 2017, 12:54 PM

Okay, I'll head off at about 2:30, so I can get time to browse Primark for about a half hour. Is it okay if I try to get parked in Scott Street car park? And not that I know of, there's like a 95% chance it'll stay that way. Why?
Aug 15, 2017, 12:54 PM
George Hughes
Are you working tomorrow btw?
Aug 15, 2017, 12:52 PM

Sure, I'll finish up around half 3 so then would be awesome
Aug 15, 2017, 12:51 PM

I could pick you up from town if you'd like. My car actually has loads of storage once I fold the seats back. I could pick your equipment up, drop it off at your house, and then we could head on to mine. Or we could just take it to mine, and unload when I drop you back. It's good either way. I want to check Primark for some V-neck t-shirts to use as undershirts anyway. What time do you want me to pick you up?
Aug 15, 2017, 12:50 PM
George Hughes
I'm just away in to town to busk for a while but after that sure

You have an ego. That ego likes to present itself as being intelligent, which you are. However, you may unconsciously feel slightly insecure about this at times, which is perfectly normal. You counteract this by using unusually complex vocabulary in every day conversation.
Here is the useful part:
You're interested in gaining female attention, right. People like to have an easy going conversation. Girls are people. üòâ
What I'm getting at is, when you use complex language, I find it slightly overwhelming and used to make me feel mentally inferior. (Do not feel guilty, all this is perfectly natural and can be taken for granted as normal behaviour)

So my conclusion is: if u want dat hole, u gotta talk like a mongo üòù

I don't think they want to make money from it as such, the only version I can find is the clip on adult swim's channel from the episode :P
Aug 11, 2017, 10:03 PM
Callum Davies
But I'd imagine they'd have developed it into a full song and given it a proper release as a single by now. Seems like a perfect money making scheme. Or just release it for free as a gift to the fans. That seems more like Roiland and Harmon's style
Aug 11, 2017, 10:02 PM
George Hughes
Not on spotify
Aug 11, 2017, 10:01 PM
George Hughes
I don't think it is a full song xD
Aug 11, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
Have they released that as a full song yet? I'd be amazed if they haven't yet

Hmm, or they'll completely surprise you with someone seemingly completely unrelated
Aug 11, 2017, 12:14 AM
Callum Davies
Wait, I've just realised. We had John Oliver in season one, Stephen Colbert made an appearance in the second season, could we maybe expect and appearance from Conan O'Brien in season three of Rick and Morty? They seem to be getting their way through the American late night hosts! üòÇ
Aug 10, 2017, 9:15 PM
George Hughes
I've heard about community but never seen any of it
Aug 10, 2017, 1:38 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yeah, to beat up the devil. ANd I've just now realised that the person in episode 2 was John Oliver. I suppose it wouldn't have been hard to get him, since Oliver and Harmon previously worked together on Community
Aug 10, 2017, 1:14 PM
George Hughes
Well Morty became a car, rick and summer became buff, there's bound to be more
Aug 10, 2017, 1:13 PM

I'm afraid I'm not really seeing it. I get the joke at the end, but is Jaguar a refernce to something?

Aug 10, 2017, 1:04 PM

I mean, so are pretty much all the episodes if you analyse them enough. I've just been watching the wisecrack playlist of their r&m philosphy videos. But yeah, pretty deep. Lots of fun too

Hmm, take it round we'll see what we'd need to do
Aug 2, 2017, 9:55 AM

It would take 2 seconds, and trust me, I know what I'm doing. I've done it many times before. I need it taken off my hands!

Jul 23, 2017, 2:21 AM
George Hughes
I should be free Thursday evening. We'll call then :)
Jul 23, 2017, 2:21 AM
Callum Davies
Basically, I'm working on Friday now, so I'm afraid we'd have to reschedule Borderlands. But Euan is still giving people the cold shoulder, so we'd probably have to play just the two of us. However, I can forsee a situation in which Euan comes back into contact with all of us, and is then really annoyed that we played Borderlands without him, a situation which I don't think we want. So should we just put the Borderlands on hiatus until we hear from Euan again? I am free Thursday evening at about 8 for a chat, though. If you'd like
Jul 22, 2017, 7:22 PM
Callum Davies
Could I call you real quick?
Jul 22, 2017, 7:08 PM

Jul 22, 2017, 7:06 PM

That's sound analysis, I think. I just don't know what to do
Jul 17, 2017, 9:03 AM
George Hughes
But that's speculation.
Jul 17, 2017, 8:49 AM
George Hughes
I think he struggles to rely on/trust people since his family haven't done much for him so he feels he has to get rid of anyone who, like his family, don't do much to support themselves/others - hence why he attacked Kyle, and why he dislikes my attitude towards transport
Jul 17, 2017, 8:49 AM
George Hughes
That's unfortunately very relevant. But I really don't know how to get through to him
Jul 17, 2017, 8:46 AM
Callum Davies
Well may I tell a cautionary tale? I have another friend, he started to act like this. I too thought nothing of it, as you are. He tried to kill himself. We got him therapy and he's fine now. I. I'm not saying that's the case with with Euan, but what if?
Jul 17, 2017, 8:00 AM
George Hughes
I'm sure he'll be fine :)
Jul 17, 2017, 7:28 AM
Callum Davies
God, I hope he's okay. I'd call him, but that'd probably only make it worse
Jul 16, 2017, 7:28 PM
George Hughes
Wonder what's going on then
Jul 16, 2017, 4:47 PM
Callum Davies
Kyle was friends with Euan on Facebook. Euan's deleted Kyle too. What's going on. It's obviously not just us, then
Jul 16, 2017, 4:41 PM

Jul 16, 2017, 4:33 PM

Jul 16, 2017, 4:31 PM
George Hughes
He's always been pretty closed off
Jul 16, 2017, 4:31 PM
Callum Davies
Wait, it's just dawned on me. When I checked Euan's Facebook friends, he only had 8 people on there. I can (sort of) understand him removing us two, but would he have been friends with Kyle and Beth and that ilk? I see no reason why they would piss him off. It seems as if he's trying to cut himself off for whatever reason, leaving only his family and closest friends. What's going on with him? I don't just think it was us two, I think something bigger may be happening.
Jul 16, 2017, 4:14 PM
Callum Davies
Maybe...
Jul 16, 2017, 2:09 PM

He appears to have unfriended me on Facebook. And looking through his current friends list, he's unfriended you too
Jul 16, 2017, 8:43 AM

You've said you're there for him, hopefully he'll chat when he's ready :/

I've got his number thanks. Hmm let him cool off from the other day maybe?
Jul 15, 2017, 10:06 PM

Well, he's not answering his mobile.

I'll give it to you if you need. I'll call him in a minute

It's weird to see season one, before the voice actors had fully developed their characters' voices
Jul 14, 2017, 5:44 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, he's probably on right now, but I'm lying on my bed, and I just ate a hell of a lot of soup, so I'm not actually sure if I'm capable of getting up to go to my laptop at the moment
Jul 14, 2017, 5:39 PM
George Hughes
I think if we just go on steam and message him at 8 or whatever, he'll come on
Jul 14, 2017, 5:35 PM
George Hughes
It also means you supported the creators
Jul 14, 2017, 5:34 PM
Callum Davies
I love the show too, which is why I bought it in dvd. Maybe not quite as convenient as having it online, but it actually being on the disk means I don't have to rely on streaming
Jul 14, 2017, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
But the DVDs don't have a "play all" feature, and no subtitles. So I can't be lazy and only half pay attention to what they're actually saying
Jul 14, 2017, 5:30 PM

I've bought the entire box set of Futurama, so I'm slowly working my way through that. It comes in one of those big dvd stacks, but one of the hinges has started to break away at one end. Hopefully it doesn't develop any further

Oh, I understand. I'm just thinking how I'll do. Well, I can obviously apply for the ¬£4,750 every year, which I think will just do me, given I'm not having to pay accommodation. And then I have a little over ¬£10,000 in the account to fall back on if it's not, so I should be fine, I think üôÇ
Jul 14, 2017, 4:10 PM

I've just downloaded it onto my phone's local memory, so I'll listen to it tomorrow if I get the chance
May 29, 2017, 12:31 AM
George Hughes
Yeah good idea, if you've got headphones tho, it's worth enjoying through good quality speakers
May 29, 2017, 12:27 AM
Callum Davies
Well, I don't want to risk waking the house up just now, but I'll look it up tomorrow. Maybe I'll screenshot your message, because there's no way I'm remembering that name
May 29, 2017, 12:27 AM
George Hughes
It's a fairly long track but I imagine you're somewhat used to that
May 29, 2017, 12:26 AM

Take a listen to How the Jellyfish Jumped Over the Mountain, by Shpongle
May 29, 2017, 12:26 AM
Callum Davies
I do. I have been partial ever since Euan introduced me to Savant
May 29, 2017, 12:25 AM
George Hughes
I can't tell, might be from a movie if you really wanted to know üòÇ
May 29, 2017, 12:25 AM
George Hughes
You like a little edm don't you? (As long as it's not mass produced stuff of course)
May 29, 2017, 12:24 AM
Callum Davies
Is that massive money? An ancient accordion? A particularly large legal brief?
May 29, 2017, 12:24 AM
George Hughes
Oh üòÇ that's kinda odd
May 29, 2017, 12:23 AM

Callum Davies
Just please don't go using the Borderlands chat to troll him. If you want to do that, add him back into the random bollocks chat, and troll him there!
May 29, 2017, 12:19 AM
George Hughes
Yeah, we need to keep doing that, it's fun üòÜ
May 29, 2017, 12:19 AM
Callum Davies
Hey, that's why I created the separate group. I said he was free to leave that one. I just need us to stay together on the Borderlands group to organise it!
May 29, 2017, 12:18 AM
George Hughes
Fair do's üòÇ I don't mean to troll him but literally anything I say seems to annoy him
May 29, 2017, 12:17 AM
Callum Davies
May as well use this one, since Euan left the group!üòÇ

If you dislike talking to her so much, just stop. Otherwise you're bringing it upon yourself ;)
May 23, 2017, 7:07 PM

I don't know. Basic human decency and empathy.

My God, what have I become?üò®

May 23, 2017, 6:50 PM

Alright Sigmund
May 23, 2017, 6:47 PM
George Hughes
Either you like her and you're denying it to yourself or you really enjoy talking to her. If you genuinely despised talking with her, trust me you wouldn't feel bad üòù
May 23, 2017, 6:25 PM
Callum Davies
I am not, but I seem to have developed emotions. I feel bad if I ignore her. I feel bad for her if I make her feel bad.

What's happening to me!?üò®
May 23, 2017, 6:10 PM
George Hughes
I thought you weren't interested in her

I should have realised what you meant haha, I'll try him once im back
May 22, 2017, 6:20 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, I meant on Steam! Try Steam, he's usually on that
May 22, 2017, 6:18 PM
George Hughes
Haven't been on steam, left him a fb message lol
May 22, 2017, 6:16 PM
Callum Davies
Not even on Steam?
May 22, 2017, 6:15 PM
George Hughes
He's not received my message nope
May 22, 2017, 6:15 PM

George Hughes
Yass only 8 more years
May 22, 2017, 4:09 PM
Callum Davies
27, the age is. Jimi Hendrix and many others died at 27. So you'd better watch out, you've only got 8 years left
May 22, 2017, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, age 40
May 22, 2017, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
I can't remember, but yeah they usually die about that age
May 22, 2017, 4:04 PM
Callum Davies
When loads of musicians die?
May 22, 2017, 4:04 PM
Callum Davies
That's the age, isn't it?
May 22, 2017, 4:04 PM
Callum Davies
Wait, how old was JL when he was assassinated? Was it 29?
May 22, 2017, 4:03 PM
George Hughes
Jk it doesn't
May 22, 2017, 4:03 PM
George Hughes
Oh it gets darker üòè
May 22, 2017, 4:02 PM
Callum Davies
This took a dark turn very quickly. We moved from harmless blasphemy to the desecration of John Lennon's corpse
May 22, 2017, 4:02 PM
George Hughes
Necrophilia?
May 22, 2017, 4:01 PM

Well, not many people, I imagine. Given how he's dead

The Beatles had thousands, if not millions
May 22, 2017, 3:57 PM

Jesus only had 12 followers
May 22, 2017, 3:56 PM
George Hughes
They pretty much were üòÇ
May 22, 2017, 3:55 PM
Callum Davies
I know they got in a lot of trouble for saying it, but it was true. They were bigger than Jesus

The only mainstream band that has ever written about being a walrus and eggmen
May 22, 2017, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
They were the only band that could have gotten away with I am the walrus
May 22, 2017, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
Right on üëåüèº
May 22, 2017, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
I always say the Beatles are a test of music. Like how the shop Next is a test of the health of the high Street. Ie, if next ever goes out of business, that's basically the death of the high Street, if we ever forget the Beatles, music is dead.
May 22, 2017, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
Their sounds are before their time, but somehow still popular
May 22, 2017, 3:46 PM

Borderlands?

I'm sure you're right
May 17, 2017, 8:13 AM

You can try it on your computer, I might have put something wrong but it said no tickets available
May 16, 2017, 10:19 PM

Aye apparently they're popular here üòÜ
May 16, 2017, 10:19 PM

How much are tickets?
May 16, 2017, 9:15 PM
George Hughes
Nor did I, I'd enjoy going if you were up for it
May 16, 2017, 8:45 PM
Callum Davies
I didn't know they still gigged, to be perfectly honest with you.
May 16, 2017, 8:16 PM

Yeah, don't know how much tickets are, though. Just thought you might like to go.

May 16, 2017, 11:06 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh, I was alone.
May 16, 2017, 11:05 AM
George Hughes
Yeah I usually do but I watched with my sister so we probably chatted over that part üòÇ
May 16, 2017, 11:04 AM
Callum Davies
The doctor says it in the episode! That's why I watch with subtitles, to never miss a line of dialogue
May 16, 2017, 11:04 AM
George Hughes
Oh shit that would make sense
May 16, 2017, 11:03 AM
Callum Davies
They were killing people. Bill's suit just didn't have enough battery to deliver a lethal dose. But the rest were legitimate corpses
May 16, 2017, 11:00 AM
George Hughes
But this season, every episode's enemy gets their justification. I guess the most recent one not so much, but it turned out they were just capitalist robots and they weren't even killing anyone
May 16, 2017, 10:59 AM
Callum Davies
Hmm, well they've had 'enemies' like that from the David Tennant era, possibly even the Chris Eccelson era. I can't really say for classic Who, I'm not too familiar with that
May 16, 2017, 10:54 AM
George Hughes
I guess. Also, do you like the fact that it shows the enemy from their perspective and they all turn out to essentially be the good guys? I believe that's new to doctor who
May 16, 2017, 10:49 AM
Callum Davies
Yes, if it does get fixed in the next regeneration, that is. I mean, it seems like that's what would happen
May 16, 2017, 8:00 AM
George Hughes
He might be blind for the rest of this series which would be intriguing
May 15, 2017, 10:26 PM
Callum Davies
Peter Capaldi has said this is his last series, and I'm assuming they're carrying on the series, as opposed to just stopping it altogether! Or at least, I really hope so! üò•
May 15, 2017, 10:21 PM
Callum Davies
Very interested to see where they'll go with this one. Do you think it'll be permanent? Surely it'll get fixed in the next regeneration, which is the end of this series
May 15, 2017, 10:17 PM
George Hughes
That face says it all.. very strange turn
May 15, 2017, 10:15 PM

So I'll pick you up at about 7:00?
May 13, 2017, 5:33 PM

And I'll obviously still be able to drive you home at the end of we're not drinking, so that's good for your family who I'm sure are eager to see you
May 13, 2017, 5:33 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, do you just want to hang out at mine then? I was going to suggest pub, but we've got water on orange juice here! In fact, we've got water on tap!

I don't mind, yours might be better tbh if you don't mind driving me. Mum needs quiet atm
May 13, 2017, 5:28 PM

Sure, if you're not having any, then I won't either. Can still hang out though, like you say. Yours or mine?
May 13, 2017, 5:27 PM

Pub and crash over summer tho üòé
May 13, 2017, 5:26 PM

Got a band rehearsal tomorrow, plus I'm staying clear of alcohol for a while üòù I wouldn't mind hanging out and chatting somewhere for a couple hours
May 13, 2017, 5:26 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not planning on having too much, but two or three is still too much for me to drive you home
May 13, 2017, 5:25 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, well if you'd like we could do a pub-and-crash (not a real word, I know. But damn it, I want it to be!) again‚Äã round here?

One cannot compare slutty demons to why not

I always get them mixed up
May 6, 2017, 10:02 PM

or is that greater than?
May 6, 2017, 10:02 PM

Hahaha self deprecation woo
May 6, 2017, 10:02 PM

slutty demon is less than why not

My costume this year will be slutty demon< why not?

That's the spirit üòÜ

I mean clich√©
May 6, 2017, 10:01 PM
Callum Davies
Plus, why do I need to put a shirt on for halowwen? if women are allowed to dress like sluts than so am I!
May 6, 2017, 10:01 PM

peeps dress up for comiccon
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM

Halloween then, but stick a white shirt on underneath
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
I'm rocking the side part now
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
Ahh
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
Don't people usually dress up for that kind of thing?
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
Got in cut, remember
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
And I'd need to grow my hair back out
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
1) It's not that kind of con 2) I'm pretty sure I'd not be allowed in without a shirt out
May 6, 2017, 9:59 PM
George Hughes
Give me one reason why not
May 6, 2017, 9:59 PM
George Hughes
Fuck it why not üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

You want me to rock up to Coxcon as Dante?
May 6, 2017, 9:59 PM
George Hughes
Something to work towards then üòâ
May 6, 2017, 9:58 PM
Callum Davies
I've got the hair, though
May 6, 2017, 9:58 PM
Callum Davies
I'd need to do loads of crunches üòÇ
May 6, 2017, 9:58 PM
Callum Davies
Yes, he is named after the Tuscan poet. Because his brother is named Virgil, the name of the poet who guides Dante through the nine circles of hell in the Inferno section of The Divine Comedy.
May 6, 2017, 9:58 PM
George Hughes
Idea for Halloween?
May 6, 2017, 9:57 PM
George Hughes
Holy shit you need to do this, you could pull that off
May 6, 2017, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
It's Dante from Devil May Cry games
May 6, 2017, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
now there's a proper demon

Callum Davies
I shall find my darkest, reddest cape!
May 6, 2017, 9:53 PM
George Hughes
Being dressed up will help cause it doesn't feel as much like it's you that's doing it
May 6, 2017, 9:53 PM
George Hughes
Style yourself as some sort of lucifer and see how many chicks you can pull üòÜ
May 6, 2017, 9:52 PM

Can't hurt can it?

Callum Davies
Oh yeah, but I've never even been close to that level of crazy.
May 6, 2017, 9:49 PM
George Hughes
Doesn't need to be amazing. You must have told a story in your past and exaggerated details to make it more amusing
May 6, 2017, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
I have no anecdote! I wouln't even be able to make one up! I'm boring, remember?
May 6, 2017, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
I am, but I have zero expectations from it üòÜ I occasionally go on it for some existential chats or quality discussions
May 6, 2017, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Or just say some weird shit: Have you ever found yourself in a different country with no idea how you got there? Then tell her some anecdote about drinking in Edinburgh and ending up at the airport in France with no recollection
May 6, 2017, 9:45 PM
Callum Davies
So are you still using Tinder then?
May 6, 2017, 9:44 PM

She's pretty hot for a smart girl
May 6, 2017, 9:39 PM

Ahh. Anyway, you don't want to be going into college already having been spoken for.
May 6, 2017, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
It goes without saying üòÑ
May 6, 2017, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
She was a clever bean, I think she was in my ah maths class.
May 6, 2017, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
Obviously, it goes without saying that this stays between you and I?
May 6, 2017, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
She always seemed like one of the more popular types
May 6, 2017, 9:37 PM
Callum Davies
Funny. I never had Katy down as that sort during school
May 6, 2017, 9:37 PM
Callum Davies
So am I to assume that you have since retired the ol' Tinder?
May 6, 2017, 9:36 PM
George Hughes
Gotta be a right speccy for a chick like her
May 6, 2017, 9:36 PM
Callum Davies
Complex numbers? OH, nerdy. Got cha. Took me a second. I'm tired, alright!
May 6, 2017, 9:35 PM
George Hughes
Pm her with some nombres complexes
May 6, 2017, 9:35 PM
Callum Davies
And that would have been one hell of an awkward convo
May 6, 2017, 9:34 PM
Callum Davies
I wonder
May 6, 2017, 9:34 PM
Callum Davies
She had an awesome bio. Something like "Skyrim and LOTR (Lord of the Rings). Talk nerdy to me!" How was I to know THAT was Katy?!
May 6, 2017, 9:34 PM
George Hughes
I wonder how Kyle is getting on with tinder
May 6, 2017, 9:33 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry, it may have saved you an awkward conversation üòÇ
May 6, 2017, 9:33 PM
Callum Davies
Not going to answer that...Ah well, college soon
May 6, 2017, 9:32 PM
George Hughes
Go find her insta and slide into her DMs
May 6, 2017, 9:32 PM
Callum Davies
I panicked
May 6, 2017, 9:32 PM
Callum Davies
I should have

Ah well, naught I can do now, can I. Deleted the damn thing, haven't I?

George Hughes
Coulda stuck around to find out üòè
May 6, 2017, 9:31 PM
Callum Davies
What I'm wondering is, why in the nine hells did she match with me? I mean, I obviously super liked her, but why did she choose to match back? Maybe she's gone mad...

According to Facebook/Tinder
May 6, 2017, 9:29 PM
Callum Davies
And she's now working in CeX
May 6, 2017, 9:29 PM

You'll feel better for not having it

Was taking too much of my time

I was thinking about it anyway

May 6, 2017, 9:28 PM

Last I heard of her, she was working in markies
May 6, 2017, 9:28 PM

I didn't realise!

Callum Davies
Comes back as a match
May 6, 2017, 9:27 PM

Yup. Well, I'm scrolling through, as you do. Come across this really good profile, like the sound of it, so I give it a super like. Nice girl, Katy, 6 miles away.

Why assume I'm high? üòùüòÇ

Yup. There's sheet music if you're‚Äã having trouble playing it. It's all rests

Is it gonna be silence for 4 minutes?
Apr 27, 2017, 1:17 PM

Look up John Cage's 4'33". It's a genuine piece of music

Nobody knows.. but it could be linked to consciousness since the act of observing the particle changes its behaviour

And nobody knows why it is. They know it happens, but not why. Oh, quantum physics! üòè
Apr 26, 2017, 6:53 PM

And also what you said but the quantum physics bit is the cool part
Apr 26, 2017, 6:52 PM

Nothing proves anything.. but kinda, it shows particles acting as a wave
Apr 26, 2017, 6:52 PM

That's the one that proves photons act as both a particle and a wave, isn't it?

Sure thing, I'll drop him a line of spag

Also, can you drop Euan a message on Steam sometime today to tell him bout playing Borderlands tomorrow night?
Apr 26, 2017, 3:58 PM

But if you keep spaghetti for 200 years, won't it go off?

But science is all about keeping an open mind, and also spaghetti
Apr 26, 2017, 3:21 PM
Callum Davies
Then again, that's a big if. I'm not saying the split universe theory isn't correct, I'm just saying at one point in history it was considered common knowledge that the earth was flat. Maybe in 200-odd years time, if the human race still exists, people will look back on us as laugh at string theory. "Those silly humans" they will say "how could they not have known that atoms are actually all connected with an infinitely long strand of spaghetti, and that the universe is in fact just one massive plate of spaghetti Bolognese" and that's why I'm not winning a Nobel prize anytime soon
Apr 26, 2017, 2:31 PM
George Hughes
Logic! üòé
Apr 26, 2017, 1:26 PM

That would make sense, however if each key pressed is random and the split universe theory is correct, there would be a universe where the monkey succeeds
Apr 26, 2017, 1:26 PM

Brainiac tested that theory, and worked out that whilst true, at the rate their monkeys were going, the inevitable heat death of the universe would happen before

I feel kinda bad if that is what happened. Anyway, not much i can about it now, if she's now cut off the only communication with her i had. Ah well, plenty to talk about at the pub, eh?

Oh dear xD some miscommunication there.. always get them on messenger ;)
Apr 14, 2017, 6:32 PM

It came up when i turned my WiFi back on with "Charlotte has liked your message" and so I thought she might have left one in reply. When i boot Tinder up, she's gone from my matches list. Maybe she thought I ditched her! Silly moo! üòÇ

Hey, guess what
Apr 14, 2017, 6:27 PM
George Hughes
Ahh some situations it would make sense, but the cost of owning the car just wouldn't be worth it in every day life for a lot of people
Apr 14, 2017, 4:38 PM
Callum Davies
Buses, maybe. Trains, I'd say that's debatable. That's why Kyle and I are driving down to Telford for CoxCon. We looked it up, and a train ticket for one of us would be double what it would cost in fuel to get the both of us there
Apr 14, 2017, 4:08 PM
George Hughes
Nahh, buses and trains are far more affordable
Apr 14, 2017, 4:07 PM

Surely a car is close to a necessity in this modern age?

I got mine for ¬£1,200
Apr 14, 2017, 4:05 PM

Most likely yeh, plus buying the actual car is way beyond the amount of money I'll ever see in the near future
Apr 14, 2017, 4:05 PM

Yup, i bet fuel is getting close to ¬£1.20/litre over there. At Morrison's in Perth it's ¬£1.13/litre, just for a comparison
Apr 14, 2017, 4:03 PM

I mean even if I did decided to spend a load of money on lessons and a test and get my license, the cost of having a car in Edinburgh is so much compared how little use it would be üíÅüèº
Apr 14, 2017, 4:02 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, THAT'S why you don't drive. It wouldn't have anything to do with the fact you don't actually have a license and therefore would be illegal to drive

But, i guess that's an extra ¬£1 every 6 hours, and i work 42-44 hours a week, so i guess it kinds makes a difference if you scale it up
Apr 14, 2017, 3:31 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, so is mine. That's why i accepted the shifts for tomorrow. Although saying that, i did get a raise. Up from ¬£6.95/hour to ¬£7.05/hours. A whole 10p! Lucky me! üòÇ
Apr 14, 2017, 3:30 PM
George Hughes
Don't apologise, it'll be good craic, I might not have much either, my bank is struggling rn
Apr 14, 2017, 3:28 PM

Apr 14, 2017, 2:57 PM

Up to you, we wouldn't mind having you tho :p
Apr 14, 2017, 2:56 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno, i may not drink. I've been trying to give up, and i wouldn't want to be a burden upon your family

Apr 14, 2017, 1:48 PM
Callum Davies
But I'll need to leave it at yours.
Apr 14, 2017, 1:48 PM
George Hughes
Yeah come by mine at 7 and we can go down and get Kyle
Apr 14, 2017, 1:48 PM
Callum Davies
Because if I'm drinking I'm going to have to leave my car at yours
Apr 14, 2017, 1:47 PM
Callum Davies
It could be a perfectly legitimate excuse. When i leave, i shall leave her a polite message, and maybe she'll text me back. If not, these things happen. If your sure; we'll work it out at the time. I'm gonna leave now; can i pick you up at 7:00?
Apr 14, 2017, 1:47 PM
George Hughes

Callum Davies
But what do i do, go up to every woman here and ask her? I think not!
Apr 14, 2017, 1:33 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha that's a possibility
Apr 14, 2017, 1:33 PM
Callum Davies
Ehh, those are the dangers of online dating. I'm just hoping she's not already here and i don't recognise her. Anyway, I've dropped her a message on Tinder

You've got to stop doing that
Apr 4, 2017, 3:33 PM

My god. So i just took my phone with me into the toilet (as you do). Accidentally dropped it. (The toilet was flushed, don't worry). Fished it out immediately after, shoved it in a towel; my phone still seems to be working! Let's hope no fluid seeps into the system
Mar 15, 2017, 8:47 AM

Mar 3, 2017, 6:42 PM

sepia will be fine
Mar 3, 2017, 6:41 PM

It's more defined in b&w but sepia looks more natural

Which one do you reckon?
Mar 3, 2017, 6:41 PM

Mar 3, 2017, 6:41 PM

I went for sepia tone. I think it looks better. Just a second
Mar 3, 2017, 6:40 PM

b&w filter should do the trick
Mar 3, 2017, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I might slap a filter on that bitch, and hide it in the back of my photos. I'll set up la tinder now
Mar 3, 2017, 6:39 PM

Yup. Well, let's say, I've taken a mirror selfie. Are you comfortable enough with your sexuality to view it purely objectively and give your opinion on the quality of the photo?
Mar 3, 2017, 6:33 PM

Does that give you any ideas?

Well, I'm not sure about it, but I know some like it. Working at the factory has, let's say, shaped me very pleasingly. And they say if you've got it, flaunt it...

As I say, 5kg one handed, 20kg if I'm using both
Feb 19, 2017, 6:45 PM

Yeah the machines are much easier, I'll get onto the free weights once I'm back to the gym and more comfortable with what I'm doing
Feb 19, 2017, 6:45 PM
George Hughes
Even one handed? ;)
Feb 19, 2017, 6:44 PM

Ahh I see. I'm talking about free weights. I could probably pull my body weight's worth of resistance on a rowing machine or on some other such device
Feb 19, 2017, 6:43 PM
George Hughes
Only on the resistance machines tho, never did any free weights
Feb 19, 2017, 6:42 PM

Feb 19, 2017, 6:42 PM

Feb 19, 2017, 6:42 PM

You lifted your own body weight? I dunno bout you, but I'm about 8st

I don't really think in pounds tbh, I'm more about dem kilos
Feb 19, 2017, 6:41 PM

I looked it up
Feb 19, 2017, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies
5kg = ~11lbs
20kg = ~44lbs
Feb 19, 2017, 6:40 PM
George Hughes
That's not bad, I usually had it about my body weight back when I was still doing the resistance machines
Feb 19, 2017, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies
Well, for me, I can lift 5kg on one hand, and 20kg using both. Not amazing, I know, but decent, I'd say. I dunno what those are in lbs; use a fucking converter! üòÇ
Feb 19, 2017, 6:25 PM

Yeah you're correct I think lol
Feb 14, 2017, 8:11 PM

I know what it is. I just wasn't sure if I was remembering the meme correctly
Feb 14, 2017, 8:03 PM

That's a trebuchet
Feb 14, 2017, 8:01 PM

What is it? A 90kg weight over 300m?

It's okay they can't hear us here üòùüòÇ

Feb 14, 2017, 12:19 AM

Its complicated. Too complicated for text. I'll tell you at the weekend
Feb 14, 2017, 12:18 AM
George Hughes
brilliant! have you got uni for next year sorted out btw?
Feb 14, 2017, 12:18 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, I know. I'm looking forward to it. Got ma ticket, booking hotel with Kyle tomorrow
Feb 14, 2017, 12:17 AM
George Hughes
I guess.. it'll be worth it tho, you'll have a blast :D
Feb 14, 2017, 12:16 AM
Callum Davies
Work and ironically lack of funds. CoxCon is expensive!
Feb 14, 2017, 12:15 AM
George Hughes
aw man :/ you'll find someone, you been getting out much or is work making that difficult?
Feb 14, 2017, 12:14 AM
Callum Davies
Nah, much to my disappointment üòû
Feb 14, 2017, 12:13 AM
George Hughes
you been seeing anyone btw?
Feb 14, 2017, 12:13 AM
Callum Davies
This is true
Feb 14, 2017, 12:12 AM
George Hughes
none of the above xD unfortunately I've not been that successful but you'll know soon enough ;)
Feb 14, 2017, 12:12 AM
Callum Davies
You've got another girlfriend? A job? You're finally losing your virginity! üòÇ
Feb 14, 2017, 12:11 AM
George Hughes
if all goes well, it'll be good news :P
Feb 14, 2017, 12:10 AM
Callum Davies
Okay...üòï
Feb 14, 2017, 12:10 AM
George Hughes
btw remind me to tell you some news when I see you on the 25th :)
Feb 14, 2017, 12:10 AM
Callum Davies
Sure
Feb 13, 2017, 6:40 PM
George Hughes
Can call in 10 mins?
Feb 13, 2017, 6:38 PM
Callum Davies
Never mind, I'll call you tomorrow. What time is good for you?
Feb 13, 2017, 6:35 PM
Callum Davies
In regards to the weekend, that is
Feb 13, 2017, 6:20 PM
Callum Davies
Any chance of a quick ring tonight, so I can let you know what I'm thinking?
Feb 13, 2017, 6:19 PM
Callum Davies
Dude, it's bridge of earn. Traffic isn't really an issue!
Feb 13, 2017, 6:07 PM
George Hughes
Jk midday would maybe be a little easier, even if the traffic will be busier
Feb 13, 2017, 3:44 PM
George Hughes
Sounds good
Feb 13, 2017, 3:43 PM
Callum Davies
Midnight!?
Feb 13, 2017, 3:34 PM
George Hughes
12ish?
Feb 13, 2017, 1:27 PM
Callum Davies
What time do you want me to pick you up at on 25th?
Feb 13, 2017, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
No. And I've just discovered that there is no extra slot. Whereas my old laptop had one 4 gig ram chip inserted with a spare slot. My new laptop has 2 slots also, which have a 4 gig ram chip in each of them. I have 8 gig altogether. So I've got a spare 4 gig ram chip going if you have a spare slot and your laptop uses DDR3 memory
Jan 27, 2017, 8:25 PM
George Hughes
I thought your laptop was just really tinyüòÜ
Jan 27, 2017, 8:22 PM
George Hughes
12gigs is crazy
Jan 27, 2017, 8:22 PM
George Hughes
Ohhh thought you meant storage üòÇüòÇ
Jan 27, 2017, 8:22 PM
Callum Davies
Your laptop does not have a terabyte of ram. I don't think a commercial computer exists that has that
Jan 27, 2017, 8:21 PM
George Hughes
Not bad üòÜ however my laptop has a terabyte üíÅüèº
Jan 27, 2017, 8:16 PM
Callum Davies
I can! 12gb! That's crazy!
Jan 27, 2017, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
I may be able to transfer my 4GB ram chip from the dead laptop to my new 8gb ram laptop. 12 gig!
Jan 27, 2017, 1:10 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that'd work, and plus if you're not gaming on it, you don't need an awful lot of storage anyway
Jan 26, 2017, 1:33 PM
Callum Davies
Only minor thing is that it doesn't have an awful lot of storage. But I'm planning on buying a SATA to USB cable and converting my 500gb HDD that's in my laptop (that still works) into an external hard drive
Jan 26, 2017, 1:27 PM
George Hughes
thought so
Jan 26, 2017, 1:26 PM
Callum Davies
Ps3 controller*
Jan 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
George Hughes
ahh, fair enough xD
Jan 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
Callum Davies
I can use my ps3 on the computer if I wanted to, I just don't PC game much
Jan 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
George Hughes
you could always buy a usb controller
Jan 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
Callum Davies
I work hard, and play hard, with my new powerful laptop! I'm not going to be playing many games though; I don't really like using a keyboard and mouse for games. I much prefer a controller. My ps3 is for games; this is for work and stuff
Jan 26, 2017, 1:24 PM
George Hughes
It's a great way of doing it, a lot more affordable, and impressive that you've paid for it yourself ;)
Jan 26, 2017, 1:22 PM
Callum Davies
Refurbished, but it's basically just a new laptop for a second hand price. They put all new stuff in it and make it as good as new, and I'm not a snob; if it's as good as new, may as well be new for all I'm concerned.
Jan 26, 2017, 1:20 PM
George Hughes
not bad at all, that looks pretty powerful :O

Okay, so you know how I said my laptop was probably dead? Well, I had Euan Reid take a look at it, and the bad news is that it is. BUT, of course, I'm working now, so with a little bit of my wages I bought myself this beast!
Jan 26, 2017, 1:19 PM
George Hughes
Aw no worries, chat later man :)
Jan 22, 2017, 2:00 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, my lunch break is almost over, so I'll have to cut our little conversation off here, I'm afraid. But at least we know I'll get to see you in February. Talk to you soon, bye for nowüòâ
Jan 22, 2017, 1:58 PM
George Hughes
Fun times :O at least you've got a good source of income ;) aw brilliant!!
Jan 22, 2017, 1:57 PM
Callum Davies
And that's me got the weekend off üòÄ
Jan 22, 2017, 1:57 PM
Callum Davies
Life? What's that? All I know now is work! No, but it's pretty good. Also, I've just sent my supervisor the text, so I'll let you know when I have confirmation of my being off at the weekend
Jan 22, 2017, 1:56 PM
George Hughes
How's life?
Jan 22, 2017, 1:53 PM
Callum Davies
As am I üòâ
Jan 22, 2017, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
brilliant, I'm looking forward to it :P
Jan 22, 2017, 1:52 PM
Callum Davies
That's loads of notice, thanks so much! If I drop my supervisor a text today, I should almost definitely be able to get the weekend off. We'll arrange details closer to the time, but I'll put the weekend in the calendar and text my supervisor just now
Jan 22, 2017, 1:52 PM
George Hughes
If that suits
Jan 22, 2017, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
February rather
Jan 22, 2017, 1:50 PM
Callum Davies
Of January?
Jan 22, 2017, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
I guess, I might be down on the weekend of the 25th
Jan 22, 2017, 1:49 PM
Callum Davies
Maybe. Work's a bitch. Plus, I'm not sure if I want to be driving in a busy city like Edinburgh yet. When are you next home? That might be easier. Bear in mind I'm driving now, so it's a lot easier for us to meet!
Jan 22, 2017, 1:47 PM
George Hughes
hey man, fancy coming down to edinburgh one weekend soon?
Jan 22, 2017, 1:45 PM

Haha essentiallyüòÜ that's pretty good, 4 minors is a safe amount
Jan 10, 2017, 7:19 PM
Callum Davies
I did get 4 minors though. Although they were for hesitation. I'm like the opposite of Toma!
Jan 10, 2017, 7:16 PM
George Hughes
That says it all then üòÖüòÜ
Jan 10, 2017, 7:15 PM
Callum Davies
Don't worry, I've PASSED my test!
Jan 10, 2017, 7:15 PM
George Hughes
Great üòÜ drive safely tho.. Don't want another Toma on the road
Jan 10, 2017, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
I just need to get it taxed and insured, then I'm good to go üòâ
Jan 10, 2017, 7:14 PM

I'm a boy racer, as well, I am. Tearing around Perth in my Toyota Yaris! üòÇ
Jan 10, 2017, 7:13 PM

Yeah that's probably the case üòÇ
Jan 10, 2017, 7:12 PM
Callum Davies
Well his dad has a Ferrari, doesn't he? Maybe a bad influence!
Jan 10, 2017, 7:11 PM
George Hughes
Nope, but his driving kinda scares me, I was in the car during his lesson a few months back and it was terrifying
Jan 10, 2017, 7:10 PM
Callum Davies
And he's still not driving?
Jan 10, 2017, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
Haha! Toma is on his 5th try at the moment... Not counting the time he forgot to bring his license and couldn't sit it üòÇ
Jan 10, 2017, 7:10 PM

Only took 4 tries (!)

you free on friday?
Jan 3, 2017, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
Mum says she'll drop me off at 7 if that's alright
Dec 24, 2016, 10:15 AM
Callum Davies
Sounds alright, just text me when you're nearly here tomorrow
Dec 23, 2016, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
Sounds good, I'll get dropped off around 8ish then? Might need to juggle that cause my family are going for a meal at some point so I'll get dropped off before that
Dec 23, 2016, 7:01 PM
Callum Davies
I suppose. I'll try to talk to them about it tomorrow
Dec 23, 2016, 7:00 PM
George Hughes
So cool that they've accepted my weed smoking üòè haha fair play but I doubt they'll be against it, it's essentially like having a few whiskeys
Dec 23, 2016, 6:59 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but your parents are cool! üòÇ I'm old enough, and it's legal. So they can dislike it all they want, not going to stop me
Dec 23, 2016, 6:58 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha I guess, I mean I told my parents I'm getting you a cigar and we'll be enjoying those tomorrow üòÜ
Dec 23, 2016, 6:56 PM
Callum Davies
How do you mean? How would you suggest I tell them I'm gonna be smoking a big fat cigar tomorrow?
Dec 23, 2016, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
I might bring a little pot just in case I really feel the need but I doubt I'll touch it
Dec 23, 2016, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
Oh damn üòÆ don't be a rebel
Dec 23, 2016, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
And I've not told mum and/ or dad about the cigars yet. I know they'll find out on the night, obviously. I just wasn't sure how to tell them, so I thought I'd avoid it. Because I'm brave like that!
Dec 23, 2016, 6:55 PM
George Hughes
Floyd*
Dec 23, 2016, 6:54 PM
George Hughes
Stick on some flux
Dec 23, 2016, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
I'll bring my speaker
Dec 23, 2016, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
That sounds very ambient
Dec 23, 2016, 6:53 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, by the way, we're going to have the fire pit out on the deck. With a table and chairs. It'll be lovely üòÅ
Dec 23, 2016, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
Alright sure thing
Dec 23, 2016, 6:52 PM
Callum Davies
When we get back to mine
Dec 23, 2016, 6:51 PM
Callum Davies
Use one of the kitchen knives
Dec 23, 2016, 6:51 PM
Callum Davies
A knife would be better, and I'm afraid I don't, no
Dec 23, 2016, 6:51 PM
George Hughes
You got one? Or can you just use scissors?
Dec 23, 2016, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Right, and nah they didn't
Dec 23, 2016, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
Did the cigars come with a cigar cutter?
Dec 23, 2016, 6:49 PM
Callum Davies
Yup. You need to keep it cool; light it just enough to get it smoking, but no more. And it's meant to be taken into the lungs, alla weed and cigarettes. A bit like pipe smoking in that respect then, I suppose.
Dec 23, 2016, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Yeah probs üòÇ it's more about flavour eh
Dec 23, 2016, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry I'll have rolled it myself so it'll be just as healthy as a pipe üíÅüèºüòÇ
Dec 23, 2016, 6:46 PM
Callum Davies
Plus, smoking a cigar is totally different to smoking a pipe or a cigarette anyway. I'll probably have to teach you how to do it! üòÇ
Dec 23, 2016, 6:45 PM
Callum Davies
And I was talking about pipe smoking, which I now know how to do anyway. I know how to smoke a cigar, you heathen!
Dec 23, 2016, 6:29 PM
Callum Davies
Well, you can bring it. But I ain't letting that shit get anywhere near my lungs
Dec 23, 2016, 6:09 PM
George Hughes
I'm gonna bring a normal fag just so i can teach you how to smoke before we use the cigars :P
Dec 23, 2016, 2:33 PM
George Hughes
Yayyy!!! :D
Dec 23, 2016, 2:04 PM
Callum Davies
Last day, lad! Tomorrow will be the best night of your life, because you get to see meeeeee! üòÅ
Dec 23, 2016, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
Yeah good plan, don't get started on smoking, I know a few folk who are addicted üòï
Dec 21, 2016, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies
I know. Cigars are worse as well. I dont plan on starting smoking cigars, by the way. I just wanted a little indulgence üòâ A treat as opposed to a habit
Dec 21, 2016, 6:02 PM
George Hughes
They're also fine with alcohol which is far worse than weed or lsd etc
Dec 21, 2016, 6:01 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha don't worry you don't trip on weed üòù
Dec 21, 2016, 6:00 PM
Callum Davies
Wait, I've just realised. Not only do your parents know about your weed, but they're fine with cigars but not weed? This line is weird, man...
Dec 21, 2016, 6:00 PM
Callum Davies
Heck, bill and Ben! But that might be terrifying if you're having a bad trip! üòÜ
Dec 21, 2016, 5:59 PM
George Hughes
Nice! And yeah for sure, I love a good stoner comedy
Dec 21, 2016, 5:58 PM
Callum Davies
And it's gotta be a proper stoner movie, like Harold and Kumar, or Bill and Ted
Dec 21, 2016, 5:58 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, alright. Don't wanna brag, but our deck actually overlooks the Glen, so on a clear night, you get nearly exactly the same view on our deck as you do from the Glen.
Dec 21, 2016, 5:57 PM
George Hughes
I'll have a scotch on the rocks on the decküòÜ
Dec 21, 2016, 5:48 PM
George Hughes
Thought you might be, you're welcome to come to Edinburgh if you ever do want to have a joint and a movie sometime üòÑ yeah sounds like a good plan
Dec 21, 2016, 5:47 PM
Callum Davies
That's perfectly fine. I was in two minds anyway. Do you just want a few drinks in the pub, then back to mine for cigars and scotch on the deck?
Dec 21, 2016, 5:37 PM
George Hughes
üòù
Dec 21, 2016, 5:26 PM
George Hughes
Btw there will be no ganja on Saturday, parents want to know that I'm not addicted so I'm staying clean for a couple weeks
Dec 21, 2016, 5:26 PM
George Hughes
Oooh good news, does that mean I get to see?
Dec 21, 2016, 4:35 PM
Callum Davies
Looks like the machete might arrive by Christmas Eve after all
Dec 21, 2016, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha okay dokey, night
Dec 20, 2016, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed, all this talk of blankets. Night
Dec 20, 2016, 9:49 PM
Callum Davies
You could
Dec 20, 2016, 9:49 PM
Callum Davies
You know, you always gain a blanket
Dec 20, 2016, 9:48 PM
George Hughes
Lucky, I've been wishing I had more weight because I've been freezing my ass off
Dec 20, 2016, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
*only because
Dec 20, 2016, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
I've put on a tiny bit of weight. But that's only my metabolism is all fucked up because of the amount of exercise I've been doing. Starting Christmas Eve it'll return to normal and I'll start burning it off
Dec 20, 2016, 9:47 PM
George Hughes
üòãüòã
Dec 20, 2016, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Bacon and eggs for breakfast, sandwich for lunch and a proper meal for dinner plus a huge pile of pancakes some nights after
Dec 20, 2016, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
A normal person would be fairly chubby on my diet
Dec 20, 2016, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Nah I feast üòù
Dec 20, 2016, 9:45 PM
Callum Davies
Plus, you're a student. You probably only have one tiny meal a day, if that. So the protein has no chance to become muscle, because it's too busy being burned away to keep you alive! üòÜ
Dec 20, 2016, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
Even if I want to
Dec 20, 2016, 9:43 PM
George Hughes
It's either gonna be fat or muscle but i find it impossible to put on any fat
Dec 20, 2016, 9:43 PM
George Hughes
Potentially but protein tends not to do that
Dec 20, 2016, 9:43 PM
Callum Davies
Or passing straight through you?
Dec 20, 2016, 9:42 PM
George Hughes
üòÜ
Dec 20, 2016, 9:42 PM
George Hughes
True, my thoughts are that I've been eating a large amount of protein recently but I haven't actually gained any fat, so it must be contributing towards muscle, even if it's only a little
Dec 20, 2016, 9:42 PM
Callum Davies
You need to have been doing something for the nothing to be beneficial!
Dec 20, 2016, 9:40 PM
George Hughes
Nah muscles don't deteriorate that quickly
Dec 20, 2016, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Mostly all the nothing I've been doing
Dec 20, 2016, 9:39 PM
Callum Davies
What makes you think that? Would it be all the drugs or all the laying in bed?
Dec 20, 2016, 9:37 PM
George Hughes
I'm fairly confident I'll stand a good chance haha
Dec 20, 2016, 9:36 PM
George Hughes
Not bad, I'm really curious now
Dec 20, 2016, 9:36 PM
Callum Davies
I push heavy things too. So yeah!
Dec 20, 2016, 9:35 PM
Callum Davies
It's not exclusively lifting!
Dec 20, 2016, 9:35 PM
George Hughes
üòù
Dec 20, 2016, 9:34 PM
George Hughes
But arm wrestling does use different muscles to the ones you lift with
Dec 20, 2016, 9:34 PM
George Hughes
Ahh decent, well in that case, you've got a good chance
Dec 20, 2016, 9:34 PM
Callum Davies
I'll have had a day off. Maybe if I had a shift on Christmas Eve, then yes. But if I can do an 11 hour shift after only 8 hours of sleep to rest, I think I'll be fine after 8 hours of sleep and about 12 hours of nothing
Dec 20, 2016, 9:33 PM
George Hughes
One problem is you might be exhausted by the time we finally wrestle
Dec 20, 2016, 9:31 PM
Callum Davies
10 consecutive 11 hour shifts makes for pretty good training, wouldn't you say?
Dec 20, 2016, 9:30 PM
George Hughes
Really? I wonder if you will üòÜ
Dec 20, 2016, 9:29 PM
Callum Davies
Gonna thrash you at that arm wrestle! I have been trainingüò†
Dec 20, 2016, 9:27 PM
George Hughes
Getting there üòÆ
Dec 20, 2016, 9:23 PM

Nor did I, I was just curious
Dec 20, 2016, 9:20 PM
George Hughes
I've not needed to take mine apart haha
Dec 20, 2016, 9:19 PM
Callum Davies
No matter, I've found out. Just give the two ends separated by the silver ring a fair ol' tug, and you'll see, trust me. It won't break it. I did it, and mine is perfectly fine
Dec 20, 2016, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
Have you worked out how to detach your pipe yet? Because I can't seem to suss it
Dec 20, 2016, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Wow well done you guys üòù
Dec 20, 2016, 4:18 PM
Callum Davies
If it's any consolation, we set a new factory record for amount of output within a single day on Saturday. So it's a good thing I cancelled?
Dec 20, 2016, 3:37 PM
George Hughes
Sure thing
Dec 19, 2016, 11:21 PM
Callum Davies
Please don't let Kyle know about our presents. It's too late for me to buy anything for him now, and as you know, I don't have a chance anyway because I'm working up until Christmas Eve
Dec 19, 2016, 1:52 PM
Callum Davies
Tis a plan then, huzzah! üôåüèªüé©
Dec 18, 2016, 8:16 PM
George Hughes
Sounds good to me üòÑ
Dec 18, 2016, 8:09 PM
Callum Davies
I've double checked with the pub, we will be able to do a tab. But it's for transactions over ¬£10 (which I'm sure we'll be spending much more than üòâ) and there's a 50p charge on every transaction, because they're a small business. But we were originally talking about spending ¬£30 each on the night, so what's 25p each at the end of the night. So there's no need to bring any actual money on the night, just bring your card. We'll put both our cards behind the bar at the start of the night and set up a tab, then just split the bill between the two cards at the end of the night. And no arguments about who's getting the first round, because we're both paying at the end of the night! üòÄ But I'll still have that arm wrestle with you, though. üòâ
Dec 18, 2016, 7:25 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, you've got a debit card, right? Do you just want to put both our cards behind the bar to create a joint tab, and then just split the cost between our two cards at the end of the night?
Dec 18, 2016, 6:57 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. But it's a five minute commute on foot. Other jobs would have travel expenses. I've not got any proper qualifications. And minimum wage for my age is ¬£5.30/hour, which is probably what I would be paid at any other job I could get, due to the aforementioned qualifications conundrum. I'm currently earning ¬£6.95/hour.
Dec 18, 2016, 1:52 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I kinda get you, there's not much you can really do except grin and bear it or find a less taxing job
Dec 18, 2016, 1:49 PM
Callum Davies
Oftentimes I feel like both. Most of the guys here are a good 5 or 10 years my senior, and I'm always thinking in getting overworked and underpaid, much like a slave. Although I guess slaves were overworked to death, and didn't actually get paid at all, so I guess not exactly like a slave. But you get my point
Dec 18, 2016, 1:48 PM
George Hughes
Thank goodness you're neither a child nor a slave
Dec 18, 2016, 1:46 PM
Callum Davies
Ah, I shouldn't be complaining. A bit of hard work never killed anyone. Except the thousands of slaves who built the pyramids. And those children in the factories at the dawn of the Victorian industrial revolution...üòê

Dec 16, 2016, 8:16 PM
George Hughes
Nope the tuition fees don't even go by me, it's the saas, I guess technically it's a loan but it's a pretty decent deal
Dec 16, 2016, 8:16 PM
Callum Davies
You're not being paid that. You're being given it so you can PAY the university to study nothing
Dec 16, 2016, 8:15 PM

I'm afraid we can't pick you up because I can't drive yet because of that bloody bus! üò§ Mum will be busy preparing the house for her childminding on Monday, and Dad will be away down to Sunderland by then. But you'll definitely be able to get the bus back. Weekdays and Saturday the buses are okay, it's just on Sunday that they're virtually non existent. Maybe I should book my next test for a Sunday... Anyway, if you could just drop me a message, or even a text if you really love me, to say when abouts you plan on arriving on Sunday. Cheers üòâ
Dec 15, 2016, 1:37 PM

Actually, the latest I can find to Abernethy on a Sunday is the number 36, which is at the main Street at 17:50 at the latest. May have to consider begging parents! üòú
Dec 15, 2016, 11:09 AM

How about taking the 19:50 (or whatever time it arrives at your house) that drops you in Abernethy for 20:03? Sounds like a good time for you to arrive üòä Just an idea

I'll bring ¬£31.60 because I think that's how much a bus is but I can't remember
Dec 14, 2016, 6:28 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I'm planning on taking ¬£30, and drinks are about ¬£3 each, so that's about ¬£6 a round. So I'm bringing enough for 5 rounds.

Dec 12, 2016, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, just for when we smoke those cigars, apparently you're not meant to inhale the smoke into your lungs. You just kinda swirl it around your mouth and through your nose for the taste, more than the effect, like I imagine is the case with weed.
Dec 12, 2016, 9:55 PM

I mean i hadn't smoked anything up until a couple months ago xD even then, i mostly smoke pot, i'm not too into tobacco haha

I'll take the second, if you wouldn't mind üòÇ You're quite welcome to have the former yourself, but I'm afraid I shall not be partaking. Also, any leads yet on those cigars?
Dec 12, 2016, 8:41 PM
George Hughes
I can assure you the second one is clean üòÑ
Dec 12, 2016, 8:39 PM
George Hughes
I've got two types on stuff, sativa with lsd and a mix of indica and sativa (both are weed)
Dec 12, 2016, 8:39 PM
Callum Davies
I'm trusting you. I won't have anything at all if you can't assure me that the stuff you give me isn't laced with anything else
Dec 12, 2016, 8:37 PM
George Hughes
üòâ
Dec 12, 2016, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
I mean it's all in your brain before you take the drug, the drug just brings it to the front
Dec 12, 2016, 8:36 PM
Callum Davies
Nope. I'm only having the natural stuff. Nothing synthesised for me I'm afraid
Dec 12, 2016, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
I look forward to it, I might even have a little lsd weed to enjoy it even more üòù
Dec 12, 2016, 8:34 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, and by the way. I know I was just saying I wanted to show you the Glen because mum was in the room, but it is also true. The glen is beautiful, especially at night with a clear sky
Dec 12, 2016, 8:17 PM
George Hughes
Lovely
Dec 12, 2016, 8:10 PM
Callum Davies
And the hunting knife

Dec 12, 2016, 7:50 PM
Callum Davies
There's the machete

Dec 12, 2016, 7:50 PM
George Hughes
But everything was much prettier last night on the trip üòù
Dec 12, 2016, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
Nice üòÑ just walked along the canal, it's so beautiful atm
Dec 12, 2016, 7:49 PM
Callum Davies
And I'm a bit of a woodsman, like Kyle. I'll use them on my trips to the Glen. Been wanting a proper hunting knife for ages
Dec 12, 2016, 7:48 PM
Callum Davies
Not dealing. Your not getting them. They're mine üòè
Dec 12, 2016, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
That's pretty neat tho
Dec 12, 2016, 7:29 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow üòÆ dealing arms now? üòù
Dec 12, 2016, 7:29 PM
Callum Davies
That's me put in an order for a good solid hunting knife on Amazon, so we'll be able to have a fire in the glen. I've also ordered a foot long machete from the same supplier, but that's temporarily out of stock. They'll send us one when they have them again. So well definitely have a good knife, and possibly a machete as well, if it arrives on time üòÅ
Dec 12, 2016, 7:20 PM
Callum Davies
The Karoom called you.
Duration: 8 minutes
Dec 12, 2016, 6:22 PM
George Hughes
Sound, see you then
Dec 12, 2016, 5:28 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, I'll give you a call after I come off work. That'll be anywhere between 6 and quarter past
Dec 12, 2016, 3:37 PM
George Hughes
Aw awesome, that might be helpful! And sure thing
Dec 12, 2016, 3:22 PM
Callum Davies
Am I alright to call you a little after 6:00 this evening to nail down the details?
Dec 12, 2016, 1:37 PM
Callum Davies
Also, I've just realised that there's a VERY high chance that I'll be driving by Christmas (because I'm going to fucking PASS my test tomorrow this time!) So I could pick you up and drop you off. I'll just make sure I don't drink anything until we're back in Nethy, and by the morning I'll be sober
Dec 12, 2016, 1:36 PM
Callum Davies
Hold the pipe by the bowl, it looks better
Dec 12, 2016, 11:05 AM
George Hughes
No worries
Dec 12, 2016, 12:03 AM
Callum Davies
Nah, going to bed soon
Dec 12, 2016, 12:03 AM
George Hughes
Awesome üòÜ feel like a call?
Dec 12, 2016, 12:01 AM

'Tis done

We smoke from it all the time and we all agree it's a really nice pipe üòù it's very cheap but it doesn't seem cheap
Dec 11, 2016, 11:08 PM
Callum Davies
You can guarantee the quality of this pipe?
Dec 11, 2016, 11:06 PM
Callum Davies
I've found that pipe
Dec 11, 2016, 11:03 PM
George Hughes
Haha the idea of living with parents feels really weird now üòÜ
Dec 11, 2016, 10:08 PM
Callum Davies
Tomorrow
Dec 11, 2016, 10:08 PM
Callum Davies
I'll ask Mum
Dec 11, 2016, 10:07 PM
George Hughes
I'll get my parents to drive me there, would
I be able to sleepover? And I'll get my parents to pick me up, or if the buses are running, I'll catch one
Dec 11, 2016, 10:06 PM
Callum Davies
So how are you getting here? And back?
Dec 11, 2016, 10:05 PM
George Hughes
That sounds great! I'm up for that
Dec 11, 2016, 10:05 PM
Callum Davies
Do you want to come to Abernethy for Christmas evening? We have a pub, and even if it's closed, we'll just go straight into the woods. It's just that I doubt the buses will be running, and I won't be able to drive if we're drinking and smoking
Dec 11, 2016, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
That'll be fun!
Dec 11, 2016, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers. I say two because one for you and one for me, obviously! üòÜ As I say, don't go mad on price.
Dec 11, 2016, 9:54 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I can sort that out! üòÑ
Dec 11, 2016, 9:52 PM
Callum Davies
Do you think you could get your hands on a couple of decent-ish cigars (don't go crazy, not too expensive). It's kinda the one thing I've always wanted to try, is a proper cigar üòÜ
Dec 11, 2016, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
Not yet, was there anything in particular you were wanting? üòâ
Dec 11, 2016, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, could I just ask, have you bought my Christmas present yet?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:49 PM
George Hughes
Haha nice man! I guess you'll have the occasional pipe of tobacco? Didn't really have you down as much of a smoker üòù
Dec 11, 2016, 9:46 PM
Callum Davies
Buying a pipe now! üòÜ
Dec 11, 2016, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Whatcha up to?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:42 PM
Callum Davies
Okay
Dec 11, 2016, 9:42 PM
George Hughes
Search tobacco pipe on Amazon?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:41 PM
George Hughes
No idea, just found it going cheap on AmazonüíÅüèº
Dec 11, 2016, 9:41 PM
Callum Davies
What's the brand?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:41 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, I see.
Dec 11, 2016, 9:40 PM
George Hughes
Think it's just wood
Dec 11, 2016, 9:40 PM
Callum Davies
What's that one made of?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Much nicer than a cheap metal pipe
Dec 11, 2016, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Haha sure I'll let you know, it is a lovely pipe to smoke from üòÖ
Dec 11, 2016, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
Well, if you ever find that you no longer need it, I'll take it off your hands üòÜ
Dec 11, 2016, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
I'm getting better at rolling tho
Dec 11, 2016, 9:34 PM
George Hughes
Hah that's interesting üòÑ
Dec 11, 2016, 9:34 PM
Callum Davies
I know. Up until relatively recently (bout 1980's-ish, I think) life insurance policies didn't put you down as a smoker if you smoked a pipeüòÜ
Dec 11, 2016, 9:32 PM
George Hughes
üòù
Dec 11, 2016, 9:30 PM
George Hughes
It's healthier to smoke out of a pipe
Dec 11, 2016, 9:30 PM
George Hughes
Stick a filter mesh in it and put the pot on that
Dec 11, 2016, 9:30 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. I wouldn't have thought you could get it to burn to a high enough temperature using a pipe, but what do I know?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:29 PM
George Hughes
To smoke my dank
Dec 11, 2016, 9:28 PM

Sure?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:27 PM
Callum Davies
Not bad. I have been wondering something though. I don't know why it's been bugging me, but could you clear something up for me?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:27 PM
George Hughes
How's life going?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:25 PM

Nov 27, 2016, 9:21 PM

Anyway, I'd be more worried about my lungs than my brain tbh. Buy one won't hurt. I just don't want my clothes smelling of smoke after! I don't need those dry cleaning bills! üòÇ

There's a whole political party dedicated to it. CISTA (Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol)
Nov 27, 2016, 9:19 PM

Oh, I know
Nov 27, 2016, 9:18 PM

Just throwing that out there
Nov 27, 2016, 9:17 PM

Alcohol is far worse for you than weed is üòâ
Nov 27, 2016, 9:17 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that sounds good, one pipe won't touch your memory tho üòù if you're still against it tho, then sure, some banter is perfect for me, especially if I'm high üòÜ
Nov 27, 2016, 9:16 PM
Callum Davies
But we're still good to go in the woods. You can light up and we'll have a good chat. Ahh, we'll see what happens on the night, you know. Just take some rolls and a six pack into the woods and shoot the shit for a little bit
Nov 27, 2016, 9:05 PM
Callum Davies
Nope. Not yet anyway. I've seen the studies. It has been proven to cause memory loss to those whose brains are still developing. After about 25, go nuts. No harm whatsoever. It's been proven. But yeah, I'm gonna wait. I pride myself on my memory! üòÅ
Nov 27, 2016, 9:04 PM
George Hughes
Defo not
Nov 27, 2016, 9:03 PM
George Hughes
Nah we'll not get drunk tho
Nov 27, 2016, 9:03 PM
George Hughes
Are you not fancying the weed anymore?
Nov 27, 2016, 9:02 PM
Callum Davies
Also, you do realise I'll probably be either greatly reduced or t total by the time Christmas comes around. I may have a drink or two, but I'm not going mad. And I don't smoke, you know that
Nov 27, 2016, 9:00 PM
George Hughes
Yeah defo, but we'll get the bus to Abernethy before we smoke?
Nov 27, 2016, 9:00 PM
Callum Davies
I want to have a nice time. It's Christmas for god's sake! Also, I was thinking we should probably invite Kyle
Nov 27, 2016, 8:59 PM
George Hughes
But it'll be unnoticeable
Nov 27, 2016, 8:58 PM
Callum Davies
You can, and will
Nov 27, 2016, 8:58 PM
George Hughes
Can't guarantee I won't be slightly high tho
Nov 27, 2016, 8:58 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry, I'm saving that for afterwards üòù
Nov 27, 2016, 8:58 PM
Callum Davies
You had better not fucking show up drunk and high when we go out at Christmas. I'm just saying that now
Nov 27, 2016, 8:57 PM
George Hughes
Haha does that mean going to watch YouTube videos in bed?
Nov 24, 2016, 1:32 AM

You may have a point there. But, I do also know that there's nobody whom he is more comfortable around than Beth. So while he may not tell you or I, he would certainly tell Beth
Nov 13, 2016, 11:06 AM
George Hughes
I'm probably being paranoid but I just feel a bit protective haha
Nov 13, 2016, 8:35 AM
George Hughes
My worry is that Kyle wouldn't tell anyone if he's not okay with it
Nov 13, 2016, 8:34 AM

So long as Kyle's okay with it, I see no problem
Nov 13, 2016, 8:31 AM

Nov 7, 2016, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
But this place looks like a new place. It looks different to the place we've used for the previous years. Rog did say that we'd have actual beds this year, but I didn't think he meant we were using a whole different place! This place looks like the real deal, I'm genuinely not sure how lax they will be on people leaving for personal reasons. I know that I certainly won't be able to go back clearly drunk or high. I'll have to keep it to just a couple of drinks, I'm afraid. And I certainly won't be able to be smoking. But we can have a bit of fun at Christmas, eh? üòâ Also, I might bring Duncan, for a ride and a laugh. I'm sure I can sit on the back of his bike. Motorbike. He's a great laugh. I think you'd love him. But as I say. I'm not even sure if they'll let us out
Nov 7, 2016, 9:35 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but that's a fraction of what you'll spend in the entire night
Nov 7, 2016, 9:28 PM

Callum Davies
Could you have me the address of the place?
Nov 7, 2016, 7:55 PM
George Hughes
I guess so üôÑ I mean you could always come to the jazz bar and drink a little but not go crazy then head back when we go to the clubs
Nov 7, 2016, 7:54 PM
George Hughes
Aww man, no worries üíÅüèº yeah spoken with Sophie and she's gonna hook me up with the dealers in Perth
Nov 7, 2016, 7:53 PM
Callum Davies
I'll be going as a young leader, you see. I'll need to be responsible. Looking after minors, and all that
Nov 7, 2016, 7:53 PM
Callum Davies
I probably won't be able to sneak out, really. But we can certainly meet up for Christmas still. You can bring your doobies then!!
Nov 7, 2016, 7:52 PM
George Hughes
Mebbe smoke a joint or two at the end
Nov 7, 2016, 7:50 PM
George Hughes
Brilliant, 9ish probs, not sure where yet, we'd meet you in town, go to a jazz bar for a bit, then go to the clubs if you're up for any of that üòù
Nov 7, 2016, 7:49 PM
Callum Davies
Because I'll be on Edinburgh camp with my Explorers unit. But I might be allowed to sneak out for a few hours
Nov 7, 2016, 7:48 PM
George Hughes
About 30/40 mins on the bus away from the centre
Nov 7, 2016, 7:48 PM
George Hughes
Near Currie
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
Callum Davies
Ah, I see. Where exactly in Ed are you?
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
Apart from Ali's piano playing
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
Plus there's fuck all jazz music in Perth
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
I'm sill gonna be in ed until just before Christmas probs üòÇmy last exam is on the 8th anyways
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
Callum Davies
Funnily enough, I'll actually be in Edinburgh on your birthday. We'll have switched places! üòÇ
Nov 7, 2016, 7:46 PM
George Hughes
Thought jazz music might get your attention
Nov 7, 2016, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
I have plans related to jazz music

Oct 25, 2016, 12:07 PM

That'll be fine, either suits me
Oct 24, 2016, 7:52 PM

I'm not sure. If it had to be any time, I would have to be Tuesday or Wednesday evening
Oct 24, 2016, 7:26 PM

Fancy a Skype at some point?
Oct 24, 2016, 6:56 PM

Sure, and I'll give you your Christmas/birthday presentüòâ
Oct 24, 2016, 1:41 PM
George Hughes
In the evening? Go for a cheeky few pints in the pub, introduce me to some interesting drinks üòù
Oct 23, 2016, 9:07 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, if you still want to meet up Christmas day, I might be able to. Might only have to be for a few hours though; what with it being Christmas, and all.
Oct 23, 2016, 8:51 PM
George Hughes
Meh, it'll be more exciting next year once your at uni ;)
Oct 18, 2016, 5:41 PM
Callum Davies
Not really. Just work and TV really.
Oct 18, 2016, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
Anything interesting happening/happened of late? :P
Oct 18, 2016, 5:30 PM

I assume you managed to get up for work then :P
Oct 18, 2016, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
Too much on your mind?
Oct 17, 2016, 2:49 AM
Callum Davies
I just can't sleep
Oct 17, 2016, 2:49 AM
George Hughes
Insomnia?
Oct 17, 2016, 2:49 AM
Callum Davies
I can't!
Oct 17, 2016, 2:48 AM
George Hughes
Go to sleep :P
Oct 17, 2016, 2:43 AM
George Hughes
My solution for that is stay up all fucking night and just have a shite day üòù it's been awesome to chat againüòÑ have a successful sleep, and have fun getting up
Oct 17, 2016, 12:42 AM
Callum Davies
Anyway, it's been great catching up, but I think I should probably at least try to get some sleep before I have to be up for *oh God* 6 üòñ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:40 AM
George Hughes
Also get this: I haven't had Irn bru in 2 weeks, we haven't bought any fizzy drinks for two weeks so I've been living off squash üòù it's something you can learn, however don't ask your mum to teach you üò±üò±üò± (epic rap battle crowd)

Oct 17, 2016, 12:39 AM

I shall be the first recorded case
Oct 17, 2016, 12:37 AM
Callum Davies
And I don't know how I'm going to survive at uni. I can't cook for shit; I'm pretty sure I'm going to die of cheese poisoning
Oct 17, 2016, 12:37 AM
George Hughes
The thought of it makes me sad üòñ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:36 AM
Callum Davies
Well, except for a bit of paper with a big number on it üòÇ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:35 AM
George Hughes
Time for a pizza.. Don't worry I've usually been eating really well, we just have very little food left to cook with atm.
Oh and your wallet is miraculously empty
Oct 17, 2016, 12:35 AM
Callum Davies
That'll happen. You go in the pub at 8, and in what feels like half an hour, it's midnight already! üòÇ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:34 AM
George Hughes
Drunk is more fun.. But time goes quicker üò¢
Oct 17, 2016, 12:33 AM

I know, I wasn't drunk.

You didn't even have that much üòÇüòÇ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:32 AM

You're right, drunk people are the worst

Keir came into the kitchen where Rosie, Alasatair and myself are sitting fully sober doing work, and messaging etc, and Keir's friend from home Connor comes in with him, and poor Connor has had far too much, "hey guys, tell me about how much I should have to drink, what should I have", all very very slurred, and we're just sitting awkwardly while he starts stroking everyone's shoulders üôÑüòÇ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:28 AM

I'll take a look once I'm back in my room.. The best thing just happened
Oct 17, 2016, 12:26 AM
Callum Davies
Just take a look at it if you get a moment, if you want to. Give you something to talk about with your learned university friends üòÇ

Good, good. Weed is healthier as well. Just don't get doing any stronger stuff. And keep it recreational, don't be going pothead on us now. üòâ We don't want to lose our George
Oct 17, 2016, 12:21 AM

Tried smoking cigarettes but weed is so much better

Scream no! And storm out. Or do a Peter Finch. "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"

Yep, it's like a disease I can't get rid of
Oct 17, 2016, 12:12 AM

I've played it no less than 80 times in my time here

Basically.. The worst thing about it is: Wonderwall!!
Oct 17, 2016, 12:11 AM
Callum Davies
Good to hear. So you're that one guy at uni with the guitar? üòÇ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:11 AM
George Hughes
Mainly cause I go around playing guitar and entertaining folk.. But yeah I buy drinks where it's due üòù
Oct 17, 2016, 12:10 AM
Callum Davies
I hope you've been putting in your rounds though. Like a true man.
Oct 17, 2016, 12:10 AM

I've been given a lot, I mean a lot of free drinks tho
Oct 17, 2016, 12:09 AM

No, not to bad at all.
Oct 17, 2016, 12:09 AM

6 weeks. So not too bad
Oct 17, 2016, 12:09 AM
Callum Davies
In what timespan?
Oct 17, 2016, 12:09 AM

Must have spent at least a hundred on drinks tho üò¢

Sometimes lager
Oct 17, 2016, 12:08 AM

Oh no I'm not going to do that üòÇ i get drunk off cheap bear and Glenn's vodka üòñ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:08 AM
Callum Davies
Okay. Oh, and by the way, I'm not saying it's bad, but if you are looking to get drunk, I wouldn't be looking to do it on single malts. You'll run yourself up a very large drinks bill! üòÇ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:07 AM
George Hughes
It's okay bud, my sleeping patterns are way more fucked üôÑüòÇ I don't know what to call it, I mean I've just asked her out and she's said yeah
Oct 17, 2016, 12:05 AM
Callum Davies
And is Rosie your new, friend? I'm not sure what you're calling it yet.
Oct 17, 2016, 12:03 AM
Callum Davies
I need to be up for work in 6 hours! üòÇ That is, if I had ever been asleep tonight. I swear I haven't slept in like 72 hours üòÇ
Oct 17, 2016, 12:03 AM

Sorry I took ages there, Rosie was explaining her homework to me
Oct 17, 2016, 12:03 AM

Aw thanks üòâ drunk me is very reckless tho, surprise surprise
Oct 17, 2016, 12:02 AM

The night was just awful. I need to choose better company next time. Like you üòä
Oct 16, 2016, 11:59 PM
George Hughes
Meh the throwing up part isn't great but if you've had a good night before that, you'll wake up remembering it to be great
Oct 16, 2016, 11:58 PM
Callum Davies
Talking to some Russians we had met on the street outside a bar. That Bar actually. I was drunk, and scared. I ended being sick on the bus on the way back, in front of people I knew. Was not a pleasant experience for me. I didn't like the loss of control of both my mind and body. Personally, I didn't enjoy it. But, each to their own üòâ
Oct 16, 2016, 11:56 PM
George Hughes
Where did you end up that night?
Oct 16, 2016, 11:54 PM
George Hughes
Yep we all do it.. Difference seems to be I enjoy being shitfaced üíÅüèº
Oct 16, 2016, 11:53 PM
Callum Davies
So I guess you're right about having to go through an irresponsible phase! And I'm under no delusion that that'll be the last time that happens. üòÇ But I'll try to be sensible from now on
Oct 16, 2016, 11:53 PM
Callum Davies
And oh, by the way. I went T total for about a fortnight. I went out one night, and got completely smashed. I did not enjoy it very much, from what I can remember of it. So for about a fortnight after, I didn't touch a drop as a result! I'm back to a sensible amount now though, although I have cut back a bit from what I used to do; just becuase of work.
Oct 16, 2016, 11:51 PM
George Hughes
It'll definitely last tho, I can make things I enjoy last, I've made a big galaxy bar last two weeks üòù that's a fairly substantial amount still, but yeah in case I don't like it
Oct 16, 2016, 11:48 PM
Callum Davies
But I don't want to get you a full bottle, in case you don't like it üòâ
Oct 16, 2016, 11:48 PM
Callum Davies
A standard whiskey bottle is 70cl by the way. So a 35cl is a half bottle
Oct 16, 2016, 11:48 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, a small 35cl bottle wont be too expensive. I'd offer you a taste of ours at home, but that's dad's üòÇ
Oct 16, 2016, 11:47 PM
George Hughes
Gotta think of something to get you ü§î
Oct 16, 2016, 11:46 PM

You know your stuff üç∫ I'll get someone to buy me a small bottle of Talisker and see how that goes down
Oct 16, 2016, 11:44 PM
Callum Davies
Talisker is my favourite. But that's a very acquired taste; very peaty. That's made on the Isla of Skye. Jura is also very good, especially Jura Superstition. That's made on the Isle of Jura, funnily enough. Another good one is Oban; guess where that's made. Also, Glen Moray, Glen Fiddich, and Aberlour.

Oct 16, 2016, 11:38 PM

Oct 16, 2016, 11:34 PM

I probably will have to, but when else will we get a chance? I very rarely get 2 days in a row off!
Oct 16, 2016, 11:33 PM

I shall, but once I'm back, we can just hang about whenever, assuming you don't have to get up for work the next day üòùüòé
Oct 16, 2016, 11:32 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, message me a date once you know when üòâ
Oct 16, 2016, 11:31 PM

That's very reasonable however it must be pretty exhausting üòÖ well I'll be back like a week before Christmas probs cause I think that's when the exams end
Oct 16, 2016, 11:29 PM
Callum Davies
Not an awful lot. Working at the local factory. It's minimum wage, if I was 21 years old! ¬£6.70 an hour, 37.5 hours a week. And it's a 5 minute walk from my house, so no travel costs. That's roughly ¬£250 per week, or about ¬£1000/month. Not to be sniffed at. Also, do you know when you're back for Christmas? We've got a pub and catch up date to do üòâ
Oct 16, 2016, 8:40 PM

What've you been up to?

Oct 16, 2016, 8:33 PM

Okay, maybe I'm going overboard there. It takes months if not years to gauge whether you want to spend your life with someone, and your relationship is still in its infancy. But I'm just glad you seem to have found someoneüòä

Sep 23, 2016, 5:33 PM

It's only a pub quiz. It's not bloody University Challenge! Anyway, didn't you spread specialist subjects? Have a science guy, art guy, etc
Sep 23, 2016, 5:33 PM

Sep 21, 2016, 7:19 PM
George Hughes
Oh right üôÑüòÇ say fucking btw , no ones gonna mindüòù
Sep 21, 2016, 7:18 PM
Callum Davies
It's 'king freezing in here!
Sep 21, 2016, 7:17 PM
Callum Davies
I've since taught myself to calm down
Sep 21, 2016, 7:16 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not worried. I'm just mocking how I used to be like that
Sep 21, 2016, 7:16 PM
George Hughes
I'm the only person in the flat who's not locked themselves out üòè and nah she'll be offline don't worry
Sep 21, 2016, 7:15 PM
Callum Davies
Either she's offline, or has turned chat off for me! Fun! :P
Sep 21, 2016, 7:15 PM
Callum Davies
Hurray for logic!
Sep 21, 2016, 7:14 PM
George Hughes
Logic is fun üòÑ
Sep 21, 2016, 7:13 PM
George Hughes
App inventor which is shit, touched on "hello world" in Java but I decided to learn more so I know a lot of the basic structure for it now, and propositional logic in maths
Sep 21, 2016, 7:13 PM
Callum Davies
So anyway, while we wait for this to develop, what sort of stuff are you currently doing in your course?
Sep 21, 2016, 7:12 PM
Callum Davies
I am
Sep 21, 2016, 7:11 PM
George Hughes
Aw right, give her a while then
Sep 21, 2016, 7:11 PM
Callum Davies
She's offline just now. Hasn't seen the message yet
Sep 21, 2016, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
Yeah it probably is
Sep 21, 2016, 7:10 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, she said "Was there something else" Surely that's a come-on if ever I heard one, right?
Sep 21, 2016, 7:09 PM
Callum Davies
Yup
Sep 21, 2016, 7:09 PM
George Hughes
Haha it's kinda excitement as well as nerves
Sep 21, 2016, 7:08 PM
Callum Davies
I said: "Yeah. Would you maybe want to try again sometime? At a nice, quiet pub this time! "
Sep 21, 2016, 7:08 PM
Callum Davies
'king hell, I must be nervous. I can feel my heart thumping against my ribcage
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
George Hughes
What're you saying?
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
George Hughes
Dunno what she means
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Let's see
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. Would you maybe want to try again sometime? At a nice, quiet pub this time! 
Sep 21, 2016, 7:06 PM
Callum Davies
Sent this
Sep 21, 2016, 7:06 PM
Callum Davies
She just said "Was there something else?"
Sep 21, 2016, 7:06 PM
George Hughes
Yeah ask that, but with the üòä instead of :)
Sep 21, 2016, 7:06 PM
Callum Davies
She just said "Right okay"
Sep 21, 2016, 7:05 PM
George Hughes
Maybe wait and see what she replies first üòÑ
Sep 21, 2016, 7:05 PM
Callum Davies
Should I say something like "Do you maybe want to try again? At a nice, quiet pub this time! :)"
Sep 21, 2016, 7:03 PM
George Hughes
Looks good
Sep 21, 2016, 7:02 PM
Callum Davies
I know it may be a little late for this, but can I apologise for my poor choice of venue when we went out? [?]
Sep 21, 2016, 7:01 PM
Callum Davies

Sep 21, 2016, 7:01 PM

Ahh, hope it goes well üòÑ
Sep 21, 2016, 7:01 PM

Sep 21, 2016, 7:00 PM
George Hughes
Any luck?
Sep 21, 2016, 7:00 PM
Callum Davies
That's what I'm doing, right now
Sep 21, 2016, 7:00 PM
George Hughes
Aw man, yeah she looked pretty bored there, try and get a second chance somewhere nicer üòù
Sep 21, 2016, 7:00 PM
Callum Davies
I suppose. I've been pretty lonely lately :'( But Laura seems to be intermittently on and off here, so I may as well try to patch things up with her. Try to apologise for the poor choice of venue last time; no comment on your music. It was just loud
Sep 21, 2016, 6:59 PM
George Hughes
Just when it happens
Sep 21, 2016, 6:57 PM
Callum Davies
Seriously!? When you planning to seal the deal, man?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:57 PM
George Hughes
Just making out haha,
well I have been working up to harder runs üòÜ
Sep 21, 2016, 6:56 PM
Callum Davies
But look at me being all romantic! So, have there been any developments on the 'making out with random chicks' front? And yeah, congrats! Just goes to show what you can achieve when you don't me slowing you down!
Sep 21, 2016, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
In other news did you see on the chat about the run I did the other day?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:52 PM
George Hughes
Yeah exactly haha üôÑ
Sep 21, 2016, 6:51 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, open relationship? And also, if you don't want to, then you probably shouldn't. You should want to put in the effort and be willing to dedicate yourself to them. It's pointless if you don't want them.
Sep 21, 2016, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Nah it's not a case of courage, I just don't want to dedicate to a person; partly cause its effort and partly cause I can't make out with random chicks on the dance floor lol
Sep 21, 2016, 6:47 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, take the plunge. A little Dutch Courage can't hurt beforehand
Sep 21, 2016, 6:43 PM
George Hughes
Naw I kinda like her but I'm not wanting to start anything
Sep 21, 2016, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
:P
Sep 21, 2016, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
Just promise I'll be best man, yeah?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:41 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I knew it! I'm happy for you
Sep 21, 2016, 6:41 PM
George Hughes
There is no such thing üò±üòù
Sep 21, 2016, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, you so do! What else could turn you to the idea of a relationship but loveeeeeee!
Sep 21, 2016, 6:39 PM
George Hughes
Hmm kinda but nah haha
Sep 21, 2016, 6:38 PM
Callum Davies
So, you coming around to the idea, eh? I think you have your eye on someone
Sep 21, 2016, 6:35 PM
George Hughes
I'm not too fussed tbh hahaha
Sep 21, 2016, 6:35 PM
Callum Davies
I thought you didn't want a gf?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Maybe it'll happen soon then haha
Sep 21, 2016, 6:33 PM
Callum Davies
Doesn't take long, so I hear. Not in uni
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
Nah haha

Soo, your 2-3 weeks into uni now. Got a girlfriend?

Ahhhhhh
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
Why do you think that?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
It's just giving it's opinion on its creator
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
I think my laptop hates facebook
Sep 21, 2016, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha I'll give uni a chance, the maths looks like it's gonna get interesting üòù classic autocorrect üôÑüòÇ
Sep 21, 2016, 6:31 PM
Callum Davies
*red lines
Sep 21, 2016, 6:31 PM
Callum Davies
Also, 'Zuckerburg' was in read lines for me, and when I went to correct it, the correction was 'cocksucker'!
Sep 21, 2016, 6:30 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha. You're going to the next Gates or Zuckerberg; they dropped out of college because it was too easy!
Sep 21, 2016, 6:29 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha good to be busy tho, and kinda, but the stuff we're doing rn is too easy and a bit dull, I've resorted to doing other people's homework
Sep 21, 2016, 6:28 PM
Callum Davies
Sorry, my life has been a bit hectic. I have trouble realising when a week has passed. I mostly count my life in hours now! So, down to proper learning and studying for you now
Sep 21, 2016, 6:27 PM

It's been amazing, freshers week ended a while ago, but it's still been great craic

Okay, straight off the bat, so I know what I'm dealing with, are you sober right now?

You've been there for one day! How? Did you just pop your bags down and whip out a bottle of vodka!? It's almost impressive. Almost.
Sep 4, 2016, 10:53 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha just a bit üòÜ sorry I went for a run/explore, running is awful during a hangover üò¢
Sep 4, 2016, 10:35 AM

I don't know, I'm a bit all over the place at the moment, to be perfectly honest.
Sep 4, 2016, 9:56 AM
Callum Davies
*ill disposed
Sep 4, 2016, 9:55 AM
Callum Davies
And I suppose, hypothetically, if should choose to, on occasion, share such material with me, I may not be too I'll disposed towards such activities. üòú
Sep 4, 2016, 9:50 AM
Callum Davies
I'm just wondering why you chose to focus on my being bi was all. Just how many of these sorts of pictures do you get sent?
Sep 4, 2016, 9:47 AM
George Hughes
Means you like girls as well üòÇ
Sep 4, 2016, 9:46 AM

*very much doubt
Sep 4, 2016, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
What's my being bi got to do with it? I very doubt you have any hot guys sending you pictures üòú
Sep 4, 2016, 9:45 AM
George Hughes
Cause you're a bi guy, so you might appreciate it
Sep 4, 2016, 9:44 AM

Sep 1, 2016, 12:34 PM
Callum Davies
That wasn't auto-correct actually. That's just what I was expecting you to say. Because of auto-correct. And which screenshot?
Sep 1, 2016, 12:34 PM
George Hughes
I showed you that screenshot didn't I?
Sep 1, 2016, 12:34 PM
George Hughes
Yep... I miss smoking weed
Sep 1, 2016, 12:33 PM

Sep 1, 2016, 12:22 PM
Callum Davies
I know. I was just wondering if you were feeling nervous and excited. I know I would be!
Sep 1, 2016, 12:19 PM
George Hughes
Not especially, but the nerves will come on the day, or they won't come at all. It's just excitement to get away at the moment üëåüèº
Sep 1, 2016, 12:19 PM
Callum Davies
So, 2 days to go. Any nerves?

It was fairly fun to watch him weigh them all out and count them a few times
Sep 1, 2016, 12:13 PM
George Hughes
Does going to the bank to pay 15 bags of money count?

Plus, it's got a psychological advantage also. Every time I touch my nose, it makes the sound of a coin being got in Mario. And when I've finished my sets, it plays the end level music from Mario, also. I know it sounds silly, but I've played video games my whole life. One of the things that I most associate with achievement is finishing a level on a video game. For example, Mario. So it actually has a subconscious trigger for me. Plus the added benefit that it just makes the workouts fun. I'm getting coins with my nose! Whee! üòÅüí∞
Aug 25, 2016, 3:28 PM
Callum Davies
And I've also got this cool thing on my phone, where I can count my press ups with it, and I touch it with my nose to count a push up. So, not only do I not have to count my press ups, meaning I can instead concentrate on proper form. But also because I have to touch my nose to the floor, it enclosed the fullest range of movement within the exercise, meaning that the maximum number of muscle groups are targeted! Neat, right?

I don't know!
Aug 22, 2016, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
Alright, well, mum's told me "we'll sort it out when i get home". We'll apparently sort it in the 10 minutes I'm in, then ill miss my bus, then she'll be angry!
Aug 22, 2016, 5:29 PM
George Hughes
No idea, my parents need to get back, cook tea, then eat then I can come out
Aug 22, 2016, 5:27 PM
Callum Davies
How soon after 6 do you reckon?
Aug 22, 2016, 5:27 PM
George Hughes
Ahh üòï well just whatever works but I may not be able to come out until after 6 cause food
Aug 22, 2016, 5:24 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then. But you realise that I'll have very little time to get ready. I'll literally have 20 mins at home, if that!
Aug 22, 2016, 5:13 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that'd work
Aug 22, 2016, 5:12 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, so should I take the later bus then?
Aug 22, 2016, 5:12 PM
George Hughes
Well my folks are away out buying tea so we should be fed by quarter to 7
Aug 22, 2016, 5:10 PM
Callum Davies
Hi, I've just realised that the last bus to Brig is at 18:26. So we may have to begin the night at 6:45. Or, I could stop of the bus I'm taking from town, which arrives at about 5:40. We could make it a long night?
Aug 22, 2016, 5:09 PM
George Hughes
Noooo

I'll ask him now. He seems to be online
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM

By whatever means necessary
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
And if he doesn't, persuade him
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
Awesome! And cheers! Yeah see if he wants to come along
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
Callum Davies
Should I invite Kyle?
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
Callum Davies
You got it. I'll see ya then. I'll bug the first round, since you got it last time.
Aug 22, 2016, 4:59 PM

Aug 22, 2016, 10:34 AM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, yeah. Listen to the song Take 5 by Dave Brubeck. It has a 4 minute drum solo
Aug 22, 2016, 10:34 AM
George Hughes
Just think how long it would have been if we had a drummer
Aug 22, 2016, 10:32 AM
Callum Davies
You went busking for 8 hours. 3 songs were played
Aug 22, 2016, 10:31 AM
George Hughes
Guitar and sax, weird combo but it works
Aug 22, 2016, 10:31 AM
George Hughes
Talking of saxophone, I went busking with Fraser and he brought his saxophone and we played blues songs with him doing improv sax solos üëåüèºüëåüèºüëåüèº
Aug 22, 2016, 10:30 AM

Eminem is an anagram of Illuminati, if you change some of the letters and add a few more, almost
Aug 22, 2016, 10:10 AM

I believe you have just given solid evidence to support the existence of the illuminati

You just need to concentrate on pronouncing the ends of the words at the quick bits. That's all
Aug 22, 2016, 10:07 AM

Also I'm not black or Eminem so I can't spit words that fast üòù

Sometimes it does sounds like you're scatting. Find it hard to make out what you're saying at some parts. Just saying. Other than that small quibble, it's great!

Aug 15, 2016, 11:31 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, ha ha. So how is the CryEngine coming along?
Aug 15, 2016, 10:12 AM
George Hughes
That would be pretty amusing, however... I have forgotten everything about blender and I'll be fairly busy once I've left home so I imagine it'll be a side project that may take a fair while to finish üòÇ
Aug 14, 2016, 10:13 PM
Callum Davies
It seems possible that we could use the CryEngine in tandem with Blender (which you of course already know how to use) to create character models and possibly render cutscenes.
Aug 14, 2016, 9:22 PM
Callum Davies
I know it was a silly joke at the beginning, but with the right spin on it, we might actually be able to turn Nazi Killer into a rather nice and subtle satire on the overuse of the Nazi Zombie trope. You've got the technical skills, I've got the game design knowledge, let's do it! üòÉ
Aug 14, 2016, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
I'll need to learn how to use it, otherwise, farewell nazi scum üòù
Aug 14, 2016, 8:34 PM

Ha ha. That throwaway fever dream of us lot making a game actually looks at least possible now. Now we just need an idea. I'm thinking Nazi Killer HD Remaster! üòú
Aug 14, 2016, 7:41 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I'm watching it now üòÜüòÑ
Aug 14, 2016, 7:38 PM
Callum Davies
Even so, I think the website has some video tutorials on it, so you might be able to get some tips from them.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:28 PM
Callum Davies
I just thought you'd be glad for a bit more than game maker, and I thought that if anyone has the know-how to use it, it's you.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:26 PM
George Hughes
That's all I'll be doing anyway so it's all good :P
Aug 14, 2016, 7:25 PM
Callum Davies
I think there's a whole licence complication if you release a game onto the market using the engine, and you're charging for it. The idea being that they're entitled to a sum because you're making money off their engine. But if you're using it for personal use, or release the games for free, then you're fine.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:22 PM
George Hughes
Wow it must be very decent then!
Aug 14, 2016, 7:19 PM
Callum Davies
Ubisoft use a heavily modified in-house version of the engine on their Far Cry games, so it must be decent.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:18 PM
George Hughes
First glance looks really cool!!
Aug 14, 2016, 7:17 PM
George Hughes
I'll take a look, thanks
Aug 14, 2016, 7:16 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, I don't know if this is of any interest to you, but if you ever fancy trying your hand at video games again, there's a royalty free professional game engine called CryEngine. You can pay as much or as little as you want for it. You can quite easily create an account, select the ¬£/$0 option, and start coding.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:09 PM
George Hughes
Fair enough
Aug 14, 2016, 12:54 AM

No, I don't know what of. I just thought it's probably an anagram. Most things are..

Aug 10, 2016, 4:55 PM

Furries are people who like, or even get sexual pleasure from, dressing up as animals
Aug 10, 2016, 4:55 PM

Aug 10, 2016, 4:40 PM

Aug 9, 2016, 9:45 AM

Or, of course, if you're subscribed to the Heisenberg 'Many Worlds' interpretation, upon knowing my results, a parallel universe will be created in which the opposite outcome of the one in this universe occurs.

Aug 9, 2016, 8:58 AM

Wait, I've got the perfect MurphyBot question. I'll give him it, anf forward you the result. Okay, but make it sometime after about 2-3, because my phone is on aeroplane mode just now, and I have a driving lesson at 11:45. So you'll need to give me time to get home and get my results
Aug 9, 2016, 8:57 AM

Aug 5, 2016, 9:55 PM
George Hughes
Noooo I'll be drinking it like a week before üôÑüòÇ I'll meet you 1ish if that's cool?
Aug 5, 2016, 9:54 PM
Callum Davies
You're going to drink an entire bottle of vodka, on your OWN, just before you first meet the people with whom you will be living and studying alongside for the next FOUR YEARS? Sure, that'll end well. üòè Anyway, as I say, whatever you want. I'll be in town from about 12:15, I'll stop by the tesco metro and pick you up something. Bring money. And have your phone on you.
Aug 5, 2016, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
I'm not wanting it for uni, I'll drink it before I leave üòù I will be in town tomorrow, but I'm meeting Kaitlin at 3ish
Aug 5, 2016, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
For uni? Christ above üòû Whatever. Actually, can you be in town tomorrow?
Aug 5, 2016, 9:48 PM
George Hughes
Aw man üòû when are you next free? And there's no rush, as long as it's before I leave home üòù
Aug 5, 2016, 9:44 PM
Callum Davies
Nah. I'm not free Monday. Also, I won't be in town all of next week. When are you wanting the vodka for?
Aug 5, 2016, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
And good luck in your theory test üòé
Aug 5, 2016, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
And also lets go to the last cast again soon
Aug 5, 2016, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
Could you do me a huge favour and find me the cheapest full size bottle of vodka you can, and I'll pay you for it üòùüòâ also check the group chat if you're free on Monday
Aug 5, 2016, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
Alrighty, have fun üòÜ see you tomorrow
Aug 2, 2016, 7:30 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then. I'm going to have to go help Mum to cook dinner for now, but I'll see you tomorrow. Bye for now üòâ
Aug 2, 2016, 7:30 PM
George Hughes
Awesaam, Merci beaucoup
Aug 2, 2016, 7:29 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, I'll be sure to leave a key under the brown bristly mat just outside our front door.
Aug 2, 2016, 7:28 PM
George Hughes
If I take all of it, I might get a good amount for it üòù
Aug 2, 2016, 7:28 PM
Callum Davies
What expensive furniture!? üòú
Aug 2, 2016, 7:27 PM
George Hughes
If you're sure üòÑ don't worry you can trust me not to run off with all your expensive furniture üòâ
Aug 2, 2016, 7:21 PM
Callum Davies
Well, we might get home at 10 PAST 8. Maybe even half past. BUT, we've known you forever, we can trust you. If we leave you a key under the door mat, would you feel comfortable letting yourself in and maybe waiting at the house for half an hour for us to get in? Feel free to watch the telly and what have you
Aug 2, 2016, 7:13 PM
George Hughes
There's a bus that'll get me to Abernethy for 10 to 8 tomorrow, the timing couldn't be more perfect üòù
Aug 2, 2016, 3:02 PM
George Hughes
How about we do both üòù I'm free tomorrow night, Friday night and pretty much every night after that until I leave for Edinburgh üòÜ
Aug 2, 2016, 12:46 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, why not? When were you thinking. Or, you could maybe come round here of a night; I think I may have some beers in the fridge
Aug 2, 2016, 8:07 AM
George Hughes
Fancy going to the pub again soon? I'm back from the hols now
Aug 1, 2016, 10:52 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha it was a pretty long stay tbf üòùüòÇ
Jul 30, 2016, 6:24 PM
Callum Davies
What!? First the Beatles, now this! üò≠üòú
Jul 30, 2016, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
Nah, I'm away in Hereford, I quit Longstay lol
Jul 30, 2016, 4:12 PM

Hey, aren't you doing that southern fried festival thing tonight?
Jul 30, 2016, 4:11 PM
George Hughes
https://youtu.be/uhyORjJ00Rk
Jul 20, 2016, 10:25 AM
George Hughes
Yeah.. Have you heard Cameron's lament? The tune he whistled after he made his announcement that he was standing down
Jul 20, 2016, 10:23 AM
Callum Davies
Well, a good pm should serve as a voice of the people, and if the people call for an election...
Jul 20, 2016, 10:17 AM
George Hughes
Oh Ikr, mind you she's not gonna call one within months of her becoming pm
Jul 20, 2016, 10:16 AM
Callum Davies
And here's hoping that if she does call one, it's after December 2nd, so you can vote in it.
Jul 20, 2016, 10:14 AM
George Hughes
Yeah we can hope 
Jul 20, 2016, 10:13 AM
Callum Davies
But there are rumours of May calling a new General Election before 2020, aren't there? Here's hoping.
Jul 20, 2016, 10:12 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha yeah  she's the lesser of the evils or whatever
Jul 20, 2016, 10:10 AM
Callum Davies
I suppose. They reckon it was her, Boris, Osborne or Gove, don't they? I mean, Michael Gove's name alone is a grammatical error. "Michael GAVE. Not Gove. Gave!" üòú
Jul 20, 2016, 10:07 AM
George Hughes
Brb
Jul 20, 2016, 10:07 AM

Tbh she's the best person of all the choices that could have become PM
Jul 20, 2016, 10:05 AM
Callum Davies
Fuck you, May!
Jul 20, 2016, 10:05 AM
George Hughes
Bring it on
Jul 20, 2016, 10:05 AM
Callum Davies
Indyref II!
Jul 20, 2016, 10:05 AM
George Hughes
We don't get a say that it's stored in our country, let alone whether it exists or not
Jul 20, 2016, 10:05 AM
George Hughes
It SHOULD have been but again Westminster taking control of things that are far removed from them
Jul 20, 2016, 10:04 AM
Callum Davies
Wait! So Westminster had a say in the vote on trident? A purely Scottish matter! The vote should have been Hollyrood's, and Hollyrood's alone! üò°
Jul 20, 2016, 10:03 AM
George Hughes
We are, unless we become independant, then they can't keep nuclear weapons in our country
Jul 20, 2016, 10:02 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh, I see. We're all fucked
Jul 20, 2016, 10:01 AM
George Hughes
The rest of the scots were like fuck no
Jul 20, 2016, 10:01 AM
George Hughes
Only one scottish MP voted for...
Jul 20, 2016, 10:01 AM
Callum Davies
What? I thought only one MP voted for? Surely a bill cannot be passed on one vote?
Jul 20, 2016, 10:01 AM
George Hughes
I do love submarines, however not the nuclear ones that have been renewed...  yeah that is true, keep four seconds at least between you and the guy in front
Jul 20, 2016, 10:00 AM
Callum Davies
Yuh. Hey, do you like tangents? Well, at least it'll give me good practice in wet weather driving!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:58 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha they didn't need to commission a pool for the simple fact that they live in Scotland
Jul 20, 2016, 9:57 AM
Callum Davies
That's how my sister learnt to swim! "Come on, kids. It's raining outside. Swimming lessons!" üòú
Jul 20, 2016, 9:55 AM
George Hughes
Ahhh yeah I can see that happening
Jul 20, 2016, 9:54 AM
Callum Davies
Yuh. Well, not outside. We live at the top of a slope, so our house is usually fine. But the primary school, which is at the foot of the hill, is gonna be flooded. Lucky it's the holidays!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:54 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha is it actually that bad? You got a river outside? 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:52 AM
Callum Davies
I'm gunna step out the house and be swept off my feet by the wind. Wizard of Oz style! üòú

Jul 20, 2016, 9:51 AM
George Hughes
Ahh [?] have fun with that
Jul 20, 2016, 9:51 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh!!!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:50 AM
Callum Davies
Yup. Our estate is going to get flooded. Just like it always does in rain like this
Jul 20, 2016, 9:50 AM
George Hughes
Ahh, is there any rain now?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:50 AM
Callum Davies
A few weeks ago, that is. I'm home just now
Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
Callum Davies
I took that on the bus. That was just at the foot of your street
Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
George Hughes
Jeez
Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
George Hughes
I went driving for two hours in that rain 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
Callum Davies

Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, it's warm here. It's just thundering as well. It feels like I'm in the middle of a tropical storm! And yeah, I do
Jul 20, 2016, 9:48 AM
George Hughes
Remember that crazy rain we had last week?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:48 AM
George Hughes
Hahah aw man
Jul 20, 2016, 9:48 AM
George Hughes
It's already 23 degrees
Jul 20, 2016, 9:48 AM
Callum Davies
And I've got a driving lesson today! I'm going to die! üò©üò≠
Jul 20, 2016, 9:47 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha we've still got sun and bliss
Jul 20, 2016, 9:47 AM
Callum Davies
We haven't had a power cut yet, but I'm expecting one soon!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
Yuh, bad thunder
Jul 20, 2016, 9:46 AM
George Hughes
There's thunder apparantly?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:46 AM
George Hughes
Jeez Toma is complaining of power cuts as well 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
Also, the lights in my room just flickered. So there's a chance of a power cut soon, knowing Abernethy. So if I suddenly come offline, it's because we've had a power cut and the router's dead üòú
Jul 20, 2016, 9:44 AM
Callum Davies
Yuh. That's the thing. My tablet has GPS though. Don't you need an internet connection as well though?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:43 AM
George Hughes
Yeah, only problem is that it's a game that you play on the move with a gps signal
Jul 20, 2016, 9:42 AM
Callum Davies
I could try it on my tablet, which is obviously a little more powerful than my phone. But I can't be bothered to boot up my tablet. Maybe some time. I'll probably have a go tonight
Jul 20, 2016, 9:41 AM
George Hughes
Oh yeah the servers were down a lot but they're working fine now
Jul 20, 2016, 9:40 AM
Callum Davies
It said the servers were down. When I finally managed to get on, my phone froze on the first catch.
Jul 20, 2016, 9:40 AM
George Hughes
Aww man
Jul 20, 2016, 9:40 AM
Callum Davies
I can't even get it to work!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:39 AM
George Hughes
You caught any?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:39 AM
George Hughes
Lol  yeah that was cruel and disturbing 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:39 AM
Callum Davies
Anyway, did you see that Nyasha turned one of Beth's Pok√©mon into chicken nuggets? üòú
Jul 20, 2016, 9:37 AM
Callum Davies
I'm joking, of course. üòê
Jul 20, 2016, 9:37 AM
Callum Davies
BFFs! üòú
Jul 20, 2016, 9:36 AM
George Hughes
Aww don't worry you go easy on me, some of my mates rip into me a lot more, and I do the same to them  but yeah same, you're one of my besties 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:35 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh, mate. You know I say a lot of what I say in jest. Sometimes I think I maybe rip on you a little too much. For I joke and laugh, I really do consider you to be one of my best mates, you know. üòâ
Jul 20, 2016, 7:45 AM
George Hughes
If you think I'm bad for not appreciating alcohol, you should see Malcolm and Callum... I'm on holiday in Whitby with them and they drink it out the bottle as fast as they possibly can while I've got a glass and I'm taking a drink every so often üôÑ
Jul 19, 2016, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
Yeah man üòé
Jul 12, 2016, 7:21 PM
Callum Davies
It's just Kyle is all I'm thinking of. Be sure to let me know of your next open mic, and I'll try my best to be there üòâ
Jul 12, 2016, 7:19 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I thought it might not be, but that's cool, make sure you invite me along some other time 
Jul 12, 2016, 7:18 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I see. The trendy one in Perth. Nah, I think I'll give it a miss for now; not really Kyle's scene, is it? Besides, I don't mind visiting Bridge of Earn, but I don't really fancy hauling my ass all the way out to Perth on a weekday. Maybe some other time. üòâ
Jul 12, 2016, 7:17 PM
George Hughes
That bar, you know
Jul 12, 2016, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
Ah, alright then. Which bar is it?
Jul 12, 2016, 7:14 PM
George Hughes
You two should come maybe, it gets kinda busy but it'll be fun hopefully
Jul 12, 2016, 7:14 PM
George Hughes
Think I'm hosting the open mic at that bar with Malcolm and Callum
Jul 12, 2016, 7:13 PM
Callum Davies
Why not?
Jul 12, 2016, 7:13 PM
George Hughes
Actually I might not be able to make it tomorrow :(

Aw man, see you tomorrow
Jul 12, 2016, 7:12 PM
Callum Davies
Hopefully! Anyway, got to go now, I'll see you tomorrow
Jul 12, 2016, 7:12 PM
George Hughes
Good luck finding another one tho, once summer is over, it'll be much easier to find something good
Jul 12, 2016, 7:11 PM
Callum Davies
Yuh, probably. Ah well.
Jul 12, 2016, 7:06 PM
George Hughes
Jeez that's harsh  it won't be your fault tho, they'll be cutting back maybe
Jul 12, 2016, 7:06 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck knows, they just called me at 9:30 this morning and told not to bother coming in today.
Jul 12, 2016, 7:04 PM
George Hughes
Shit! How come??
Jul 12, 2016, 7:03 PM
Callum Davies
No, I lost my job üòû
Jul 12, 2016, 7:02 PM

Not much tbh, had the girl around earlier but she's just left, you done much today?
Jul 12, 2016, 7:01 PM
Callum Davies
Yuh, what's up with you?
Jul 12, 2016, 7:01 PM
George Hughes
Aw man, hate that feeling, chat tho 
Jul 12, 2016, 7:00 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then. I'm at a bit of a loose end, got nothing to do!
Jul 12, 2016, 6:59 PM

Jul 12, 2016, 1:27 PM
Callum Davies
But did you get a good recording in the end?
Jul 12, 2016, 1:27 PM
George Hughes
Yeah it is pretty amusing üôÑ
Jul 12, 2016, 1:25 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, bugger! But just a little bit funny, you have to admit
Jul 12, 2016, 1:23 PM
George Hughes
I'm annoyed I went to record my mandolin solo, did 10 takes and turns out o was recording the wrong input 
Jul 12, 2016, 1:22 PM
George Hughes
Sounds awesome!
Jul 12, 2016, 1:22 PM

It was good. I only had a couple, becuase I know when to stop, unlike this guy! ‚òùüèª Ha ha, but I couldn't have that much anyway because I had work the next day. But it was fun.
Jun 28, 2016, 6:06 PM

Callum Davies
By the way, I was just wondering if you wanted to maybe meet up with me, Beth and Kyle at the pub, wait, ahhh! üòÅüòÇ
Jun 28, 2016, 6:03 PM

Jun 28, 2016, 6:01 PM
George Hughes
Ahh I guess, don't tire yourself out too much tho  what days do you get off?
Jun 28, 2016, 6:00 PM
Callum Davies
More money that way. I've got to earn as much as I can in my gap year, to make sure I have plenty for university.
Jun 28, 2016, 6:00 PM
George Hughes
Fair enough lol, jeez that must be exhausting, what made you want to work full time?
Jun 28, 2016, 5:59 PM

So, I might need a wingman on Friday, do you reckon you're up for it when you're not on stage? üòâ
Jun 7, 2016, 11:54 PM
George Hughes
Ahh sounds good
Jun 7, 2016, 11:53 PM
Callum Davies
That's why
Jun 7, 2016, 11:52 PM
Callum Davies
She's taking psychology at college this year
Jun 7, 2016, 11:52 PM
George Hughes
Ohh my ahaha
Jun 7, 2016, 11:51 PM
Callum Davies
The psychologist. He theorised psychosexual development
Jun 7, 2016, 11:51 PM
George Hughes
What's that?
Jun 7, 2016, 11:51 PM
Callum Davies
I know. We've just had a chat about Freud
Jun 7, 2016, 11:50 PM
George Hughes
Ahh fair enough, keep your head high tho üòù
Jun 7, 2016, 11:50 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not sure if I've asked her out. I'm taking it slow. I've just asked her to the gig. Not sure if she thinks it's a date or not. So don't speak too soon, is all.
Jun 7, 2016, 11:49 PM
George Hughes
Aww cute lucky Laura
Jun 7, 2016, 11:48 PM
Callum Davies
I'll be needing that ticket after all. I'll pay you on Thursday
Jun 7, 2016, 11:31 PM
George Hughes
Ahaha fair enough
Jun 7, 2016, 11:18 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, what can I say? It's been a while.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:42 PM
George Hughes
Ooh cheeky
Jun 7, 2016, 10:41 PM
Callum Davies
nudge,nudge, wink,wink
Jun 7, 2016, 10:40 PM
Callum Davies
Yes she does. Just a short skip and a hop from each other's houses ;)
Jun 7, 2016, 10:39 PM
George Hughes
Yeah sure thing, I don't think we're gonna sell out anyways üòù but that's cute, she lives in Abernathy as well doesn't she?
Jun 7, 2016, 10:39 PM
Callum Davies
If worst comes to worst, could you maybe reserve a ticket on the night, and I'll pay you then. Just in case she only replies very late.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:38 PM
Callum Davies
She was always VERY friendly in the school corridors. And once, at the pub, she drunkenly said that she liked me. So, it may have just been beer goggles, or alcohol expressing her inner thoughts. Either way, I'd really quite like to know. So, here goes. I'm inviting her to your gig thing.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:37 PM
George Hughes
What're the signs you've been seeing?
Jun 7, 2016, 10:36 PM
George Hughes
Aww that's cute üòù
Jun 7, 2016, 10:35 PM
Callum Davies
I think she's liked me for quite a few years! ;)
Jun 7, 2016, 10:32 PM
George Hughes
Aye I do, how long have you liked her? üòÜ
Jun 7, 2016, 10:32 PM
Callum Davies
I'm assuming you get the gist of why I'm asking this?
Jun 7, 2016, 10:31 PM
George Hughes
Awesome üòé
Jun 7, 2016, 10:31 PM
Callum Davies
So I'll need to buy a ticket on Thursday then, maybe. I'll let you know.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:28 PM
Callum Davies
I will.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:28 PM
George Hughes
I doubt it, but you should ask her if she wants to? üòâ
Jun 7, 2016, 10:28 PM
Callum Davies
Just one, maybe. You happen to know if Laura Ferguson is going, do you? You can probably guess the reason ;)
Jun 7, 2016, 10:27 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I've got a few spares, how many you wanting? üòù
Jun 7, 2016, 10:26 PM
Callum Davies
Are there any tickets left for the gig this Friday?
Jun 7, 2016, 10:24 PM
George Hughes
Nice nice
Jun 6, 2016, 3:38 PM
Callum Davies
Just asking Lauren now. This is the actual post to the group : "Hi Everyone,

We are putting out a press release for the Youth Arts festival. Are any of you available this Thursday at 4pm to come to PCH and get your picture taken for the papers?

Let me know.

Thanks"
Jun 6, 2016, 3:37 PM
George Hughes
That sounds fine to me, any idea how long?
Jun 6, 2016, 3:36 PM
Callum Davies
Hey George, it may be that on Thursday at 4:00, I have to get my picture taken at the concert hall for pyt. If i go there, I doubt it'll take too long, so how about we go our seperate ways at 4:00, then after the picture i'll call you to meet up again in town until i have to go to pyt at 6:30? how does that sound?
Jun 6, 2016, 3:35 PM
George Hughes
Exactly, and same üòé
Jun 6, 2016, 9:50 AM
Callum Davies
Cheers. The human person needs companionship! I'm looking forward to it üòÅ
Jun 6, 2016, 9:47 AM
George Hughes
Aye that's what study leave does to you üòÜ we just need to keep meeting up, Toma got really down when he didn't meet anyone for months. And yeah there's plenty of time üòù
Jun 6, 2016, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
Could we maybe also stop off at the bank? I need to deposit some money üòÄ
Jun 6, 2016, 9:43 AM
Callum Davies
Cheers. Oh, and I'm not sure if I'll actually eat at KFC (I don't usually eat lunch). But I'll be more than happy for the company! üòÅ In honesty, I've been feeling a little down, as of late, and I think I'm feeling a little lonely. A day out with friends ought to fix that right up! üòÅ
Jun 6, 2016, 9:41 AM
George Hughes
Aye we've got a few hours, may as well wander round the shops
Jun 6, 2016, 9:39 AM
Callum Davies
Anyway. Do you think while we're out, we might be able to stop off at CeX and GAME? There's a game I'm looking for
Jun 6, 2016, 9:38 AM
George Hughes
Oh wait, I'm on iOS so the emojis are probably different, it comes up as a pair of skis for me üòÇ
Jun 6, 2016, 9:37 AM
Callum Davies
Oh. I thought it was a guy skiing. I didn't look at it properly! üòÇ
Jun 6, 2016, 9:37 AM
George Hughes
I don't think those skis are wearing socks
Jun 6, 2016, 9:36 AM
George Hughes
That's a pair of skiis üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Jun 6, 2016, 9:36 AM
Callum Davies
Awesome socks üéø That bloke is probably wearing socks üòõ
Jun 6, 2016, 9:35 AM
George Hughes
We could get on the same bus actually
Jun 6, 2016, 9:34 AM
George Hughes
Awesaam, and yeah defo, it does depend what bus I can get in
Jun 6, 2016, 9:34 AM
Callum Davies
Is it possible for you and Sunil to wait until about 2:20-25?
Jun 6, 2016, 9:34 AM
Callum Davies
Kk. I'll see what bus I can get in
Jun 6, 2016, 9:33 AM
George Hughes
I can't find any beans tho
Jun 6, 2016, 9:32 AM

Jun 6, 2016, 9:32 AM
George Hughes
And yeah that's the one
Jun 6, 2016, 9:31 AM
George Hughes
Aye we can stay out til then
Jun 6, 2016, 9:31 AM
Callum Davies
Okay, but I'll need to walk up to the big Tesco by town for 6:15-20. Do you think we'll be out that long? Else it seems kind of pointless me going back only to come straight back in. And do you mean the ring with the statue of the old man and the boy?
Jun 6, 2016, 9:30 AM
George Hughes
Well I'm going into town to go to kfc with Sunil, I was wondering if you wanted to join us? It'd be 2:00 that we're meeting, probs by the ring area in town
Jun 6, 2016, 9:19 AM
Callum Davies
Well, I have youth theatre at 6:30pm. So I'll maybe need to take a bus into Bridge of Earn, carry my PYT bag around with me, then take the 18:00 bus from bridge of earn main street into town. Why do you ask?
Jun 6, 2016, 8:13 AM
George Hughes
Hey, are you free on Thursday?

Ahaha not really, energy drinks help as well, I crowd surfed last time I went to a gig and drunk energy drinks
Nov 15, 2015, 3:00 PM

Well, there's a name for that. A dependence!
Nov 15, 2015, 2:59 PM

Aw nice, ahaha it sure makes it better tho XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:58 PM

Don't need alcohol to have a good time!
Nov 15, 2015, 2:57 PM
Callum Davies
Well I know the pub in Abernethy lets me and Nyasha in. We just order a coke and have a chat
Nov 15, 2015, 2:57 PM
George Hughes
No in a pub XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:56 PM
Callum Davies
Nowhere in Brig we can go a drink and a chat?
Nov 15, 2015, 2:55 PM
George Hughes
Ahaha recording with Toma today, won't have time
Nov 15, 2015, 2:55 PM
Callum Davies
Not even for a few hours? I feel like going out tonight!
Nov 15, 2015, 2:54 PM
George Hughes
Aye I probs will, not tonight ahaha school night
Nov 15, 2015, 2:54 PM
Callum Davies
So anyway, are you going out anywhere tonight?
Nov 15, 2015, 2:52 PM
Callum Davies
Relationships can be hard, but if you find the right person, you'll want to make the effort
Nov 15, 2015, 2:51 PM
Callum Davies
I guess if I find the right person, I'll want to hold on to her. But in the meantime I'll have a great time being single!
Nov 15, 2015, 2:50 PM
George Hughes
I tend to avoid relationships most of the time
Nov 15, 2015, 2:50 PM
Callum Davies
But I'll be honest, one night stands can be very fun üòâ
Nov 15, 2015, 2:49 PM
George Hughes
I'll find the right person when I do, my passion lies elsewhere
Nov 15, 2015, 2:49 PM
George Hughes
Aye that makes sense, It's shallow but it's not souless
Nov 15, 2015, 2:49 PM
Callum Davies
I'll be honest George, I didn't think you were that shallow. Don't you ever feel the desire to find someone you can know and love, not just have sex with?
Nov 15, 2015, 2:48 PM
Callum Davies
One night stands are fine, if you're into that. But I'd just feel hollow and soulless. I want to get to know someone on a personal level. And for that, I find an actual personality is needed.
Nov 15, 2015, 2:47 PM
George Hughes
Ah okay lol who says I'm after relationships, one night stands are fine if the girl is unintelligent XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:45 PM
Callum Davies
That's what ended my relationship with Emma. I could not get a decent conversation out of her
Nov 15, 2015, 2:43 PM
George Hughes
Most girls are after a guy who has power, most hot girls anyway, aye I'm that shallow XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:43 PM
Callum Davies
Yes, but the interesting and intelligent guy gets the QUALITY girl, with whom he can participate in interesting conversation
Nov 15, 2015, 2:42 PM
George Hughes
And*
Nov 15, 2015, 2:40 PM
George Hughes
Aye plus the popular guy gets the girls an attention, people like attention ahaha XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:40 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, I've been trying to be more social and meet new people lately, so I completely get where you're coming from
Nov 15, 2015, 2:39 PM
Callum Davies
I am by no means saying that one should not strive to befriend new companions - humans are social animals - I am merely saying you need people who are close to you also. Which is what you just said lol üòù
Nov 15, 2015, 2:38 PM
George Hughes
I like having those few people but I also like my following, even if I don't know them very well

Ah, the concept of popularity is a somewhat shallow pursuit, wouldn't you say. I'd rather have a few people with whom I feel I can reside in than a group of people I barely know. Quality over quantity.
Nov 15, 2015, 2:36 PM
George Hughes
Aye kinda üòÇ not in terms of popular tho XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:32 PM

Nerd is the new cool! You can be both, you know.

Ahaha I'm becoming cool, soon I will no longer be a nerd üòèüòÇ

Oct 15, 2015, 4:41 PM
George Hughes
It was only practising and an open mic, the gig is tomorrow, but it was good anyhow. How has your holiday been so far?
Oct 15, 2015, 11:49 AM
Callum Davies
Good, good thanks. So how was the gigging yesterday?
Oct 15, 2015, 11:38 AM

Yes, I do. Still a cheap shot. And that would imply that you fucked her, in order for you to be able to unfuck her. Did you? Lol üòù

Well, it's what most of the student loans are spent on anyway! Got to go now. See you later
Aug 16, 2015, 3:17 PM
George Hughes
Yeah they do, it's at 3% at the moment
Aug 16, 2015, 3:16 PM
George Hughes
Haha never heard that before XD
Aug 16, 2015, 3:16 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not sure
Aug 16, 2015, 3:15 PM
Callum Davies
Student loan, or as they're more commonly called, Beer Budget! :-P
Aug 16, 2015, 3:15 PM
George Hughes
Is there interest on it? I don't think there is
Aug 16, 2015, 3:15 PM
George Hughes
True, but it's not heavily enforced, you can pay it back over a long period of time
Aug 16, 2015, 3:15 PM
Callum Davies
You still have to pay it back though. It's not free money :-(
Aug 16, 2015, 3:14 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, yea. üòÑ
Aug 16, 2015, 3:13 PM
George Hughes
Sorry, I meant student loan XD not a grant
Aug 16, 2015, 3:13 PM
Callum Davies
Yea, but do you know how hard it is to get a government grant? Chances are that you'll have to take a student loan.
Aug 16, 2015, 3:12 PM
George Hughes
Or simple should I say
Aug 16, 2015, 3:12 PM
George Hughes
Haha yeah, it's also very confusing to get around XD
Aug 16, 2015, 3:12 PM
George Hughes
I've looked up the website and as far as I can tell, the government pay for everything for the uni and then you use your grant to buy books etc
Aug 16, 2015, 3:11 PM
Callum Davies
But I should talk. I'm wanting to go to Edinburgh, which is famous for being cheap to live in(!)
Aug 16, 2015, 3:11 PM
Callum Davies
Books, the fees that the actual unis charge themselves that aren't tuition related, and loads more. It's very expensive
Aug 16, 2015, 3:10 PM
George Hughes
Only living, as far as I know
Aug 16, 2015, 3:09 PM
Callum Davies
You still have other costs aside from tuition fees...
Aug 16, 2015, 3:09 PM
George Hughes
No it shouldn't do, free education in Scotland and stuff XD
Aug 16, 2015, 3:08 PM
Callum Davies
It's a good uni, but expensive
Aug 16, 2015, 3:08 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, St Andrews is going to cost a pretty penny if you do apply.
Aug 16, 2015, 3:08 PM
George Hughes
Sweet, napier looks good for performing arts
Aug 16, 2015, 3:08 PM
Callum Davies
I know. My first choice is a degree in Acting and English at the Edinburgh Napier University.
Aug 16, 2015, 3:07 PM
George Hughes
Not entirely sure, but Abertay, Stirling and St Andrews are my main ones, what ones are you going to apply for? I hear Edinburgh have good acting universities btw
Aug 16, 2015, 3:06 PM
Callum Davies
Cool. Do you have an idea of which uni(s) you're going to apply to yet?
Aug 16, 2015, 3:05 PM
George Hughes
Haha if anywhere, uni XD
Aug 16, 2015, 3:04 PM
Callum Davies
Cool, sounds like you're going places! üòÑ
Aug 16, 2015, 3:04 PM

Haha I wish, still stuck at 3 figures ugh XD
It's going good though, got a busking amp for busy days üòÑ
Aug 16, 2015, 3:03 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, thanks. How's the busking going by the way? Are the profits in 4 figures yet? :-P
Aug 16, 2015, 3:02 PM
George Hughes
That's true, well there's no reason you shouldn't get one in that case üòÉ
Aug 16, 2015, 3:00 PM
Callum Davies
Hopefully I get called in for an interviewüòÑ
Aug 16, 2015, 3:00 PM
Callum Davies
Basically a bit of drama experience elsewhere, ie at school, ability to either play piano or guitar, and good nat 5 and higher grades in drama. All of which I have üòÑ
Aug 16, 2015, 2:59 PM
George Hughes
What do you need for directing at horsecross then?
Aug 16, 2015, 2:57 PM

Aug 16, 2015, 2:57 PM

Not much, applying for a directing job at Horsecross, looking towards uni, holiday homework, learning to drive. The normal stuff üòú

Jun 4, 2015, 11:04 AM

As I say, that's my guess. I'd have to cross reference every person that falls under Ross C on the pupil register to know for sure. I'll do it with the email address book at the library. I'll let you know then
Jun 4, 2015, 11:04 AM
George Hughes
really, Ross Crawford reverted it back
Jun 4, 2015, 11:02 AM
Callum Davies
The name of the Instagram account under that name is Ross C. My best guess it it's Ross Crawford! Got him!
Jun 4, 2015, 11:02 AM
George Hughes
Let me know who it is once you know

Found his twitter account, I've got him! Give me a min, and I'll find out his identity. He must have left a trace somewhere
Jun 4, 2015, 11:00 AM
George Hughes
The name sounds like a pupil
Jun 4, 2015, 11:00 AM
George Hughes
Haha cool
Jun 4, 2015, 10:59 AM
Callum Davies
I know, says he's Scottish, so could be a pupil, or teacher, I'm investigating further as I speak
Jun 4, 2015, 10:59 AM
George Hughes
No wasn't me haha
Jun 4, 2015, 10:58 AM
Callum Davies
Just had a little investigate, the page was edited by some bloke called NewTestLeper79
Jun 4, 2015, 10:57 AM
Callum Davies
The Perth high school Wikipedia page has been changed, with our additions, and the stuff about Mr. Flood gone. Wouldn't have anything to do with you would it. It says it was modified yesterday at quarter past one.

Alright then, Mum's calling me to tea now, so see you tomorrow
Jun 2, 2015, 6:39 PM
George Hughes
Ahhh Yeah I had 25 instead of 35 for some reason
Jun 2, 2015, 6:38 PM
Callum Davies
5C = 35
Jun 2, 2015, 6:38 PM
George Hughes
Oh
Jun 2, 2015, 6:37 PM
Callum Davies
I got C as 7
Jun 2, 2015, 6:37 PM
George Hughes
Oh, so A is -3 and c is 5 right
Jun 2, 2015, 6:37 PM
Callum Davies
Ergo B = -14
Jun 2, 2015, 6:36 PM
Callum Davies
I got 3B = -42
Jun 2, 2015, 6:36 PM
Callum Davies
Let me check
Jun 2, 2015, 6:35 PM
George Hughes
No thanks, but I will ask, did you get 12B = 42 for 2d cause that threw me
Jun 2, 2015, 6:35 PM
Callum Davies
Do you want me to send you my answers?
Jun 2, 2015, 6:34 PM
George Hughes
Oh right
Jun 2, 2015, 6:33 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, okay, I did up to 3d
Jun 2, 2015, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Oh, I haven't done that yet, but I got a strange number for 2d so that's where I stopped
Jun 2, 2015, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
Question 3d, for the maths
Jun 2, 2015, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
Yeah let's do that, and what's a q 3d?
Jun 2, 2015, 6:30 PM
Callum Davies
I have mine 1,2,5,6 so do you want to study together 5 & 6. Also, did you do q 3d?
Jun 2, 2015, 6:30 PM
George Hughes
Are those when any of your are
Jun 2, 2015, 6:29 PM

Well, when it comes to their cows, they do make a lot of cuts! Proper joke!
May 25, 2015, 5:45 PM

May 25, 2015, 5:36 PM

Yeah, chemistry lol. How does "Thankfully" translate into what looks like an Icelandic curse lol
May 25, 2015, 5:35 PM
George Hughes
Predictive couldn't even fix that one XD
May 25, 2015, 5:35 PM

May 25, 2015, 5:34 PM

Have you done all your exams now?
May 25, 2015, 5:33 PM
George Hughes
I probably would, yeah
May 25, 2015, 5:32 PM
George Hughes
Plus I don't play games apart from 2048 and minecraft nowadays
May 25, 2015, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough, but I do think you'd like it, very puzzle-orientated
May 25, 2015, 5:32 PM
George Hughes
Meh I'm not mad on xbox
May 25, 2015, 5:31 PM
Callum Davies
Pretty sure it's on the 360
May 25, 2015, 5:31 PM
George Hughes

May 25, 2015, 5:31 PM
George Hughes
I would have enjoyed a 2D game cube version
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
It is great
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
It looks good though
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
Hmm sounds intriguing however I'll probably never play it
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
If you ever do play Portal 2, I'll just say that the final level escalates very quickly 
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
Portal 2 will have so much more support cause companies will have seen its potential and invested
May 25, 2015, 5:29 PM
Callum Davies
Such different games in length. Took me about a year to complete Portal 2, took me an afternoon to complete the first one!
May 25, 2015, 5:28 PM
George Hughes
But yeah I felt a bit worried but there's no use in getting upset when you can't do anything now
May 25, 2015, 5:28 PM
George Hughes
Hoho
May 25, 2015, 5:28 PM
Callum Davies
I wasn't quite in tears about it, I was literally just a bit worried for a bit and then felt better after I heard what other people had to say about it and then went home and ate some cake...which was a lie! #portalreference
May 25, 2015, 5:27 PM
George Hughes
Yeah exactly, when I heard there had been tears over it I felt much better
May 25, 2015, 5:26 PM
Callum Davies
Well I actually felt a lot better when other people said that they found it really hard also, made me feel less stupid!
May 25, 2015, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
That'll be why there's such a huge deal being made
May 25, 2015, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
Haha I haven't heard that, sheesh it's getting a bit out of hand, all of us felt bad coming out the exam but when we went to bed, it would have felt a he'll of a lot worse than it actually was, you know
May 25, 2015, 5:24 PM
Callum Davies
The SQA have even had to release a press statement on their website telling concerned parents to CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!! ...Although perhaps not in those EXACT words 
May 25, 2015, 5:22 PM
George Hughes
Not in a sadistic way of course xD
May 25, 2015, 5:21 PM
George Hughes
And I was so relieved that people were crying about it cause I didn't feel that bad
May 25, 2015, 5:20 PM
George Hughes
But yeah I read the article in the Scotsman the day after
May 25, 2015, 5:20 PM
George Hughes
That's exactly what I said to my family, it's another nat 5 English XD
May 25, 2015, 5:20 PM
Callum Davies
Have you the news story about it? It's like the N5 English "benign neglect" question all over again!
May 25, 2015, 5:19 PM
George Hughes
It was a horrible exam though, hope we've done alright
May 25, 2015, 5:18 PM
Callum Davies
Perfectly alright :-)
May 25, 2015, 5:18 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's what I got, but my grandad got a different answer when he tried it, thanks for confirming my answer 
May 25, 2015, 5:17 PM
Callum Davies
Yuh, I can't exactly remember which way round it was, but one was 52ft and the other was 48ft, so doesn't make it
May 25, 2015, 5:16 PM
George Hughes
Ah right, you've still got chemistry, well hopefully the revision goes well. I was gonna ask you as well for the frog and toad question in maths, did you get that one of them never makes it up
May 25, 2015, 5:15 PM
Callum Davies
Just wondering, I'm in for a chemistry revision class is all
May 25, 2015, 5:13 PM
George Hughes
Sweet haha, and nah I won't be, why?
May 25, 2015, 5:13 PM
Callum Davies
Don't worry, I will keep it up, I just give credit where it's due. BTW are you in school tomorrow?
May 25, 2015, 5:11 PM
George Hughes
Haha thanks, make sure you keep up your satire though, mine only appears once every decade  no competition here
May 25, 2015, 5:10 PM
Callum Davies
Not bad, it seems I have some competition in the field of political satire lol. You, my friend, truly have your finger on the pulse of current affairs. A doff of the satirist's cap to you sir, kudos, very funny 
May 25, 2015, 5:07 PM
George Hughes
Hey, how's you?
May 25, 2015, 5:05 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, wassup?
May 25, 2015, 5:05 PM
George Hughes
See you later then
May 7, 2015, 12:09 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then, that seems good for me, see you then.
May 7, 2015, 12:08 PM
George Hughes
Well, we could do it in the evening at some point, and yeah feel free to record it. Between 6 and 8 maybe, I'll need to check when's good
May 7, 2015, 12:01 PM
Callum Davies
I'm up for intelligent debate. Voltaire once said "I do not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it". Well with me it's more like, " I do not agree with what you say, but I will still respect your right to hold them, for they are your own, just as mine are mine own". When do want to do it, and would you mind if I filmed it as an election special for my channel?
May 7, 2015, 11:51 AM
George Hughes
Yeah I'm still up, looking forward to the potential interesting and intelligent debate we may possibly have depending on if our views conflict 
May 7, 2015, 11:27 AM
Callum Davies
Are you still up for skyping tonight. It's election day! 
May 7, 2015, 10:08 AM
George Hughes
Thanks, see you!
May 5, 2015, 10:46 AM
Callum Davies
Thanks, good luck to you for tomorrow as well, see you later 
May 5, 2015, 10:46 AM
George Hughes
I could very well have XD Okay doke, good idea, talk to you later and good luck again
May 5, 2015, 10:45 AM
Callum Davies
Cool, or you could have just googled it! I'm going to have to go now, gonna take a walk into town, just to clear my head before the exam
May 5, 2015, 10:44 AM
George Hughes
Ahhh sense makes more now, I admit I only came across it because of Colin Meloy a few weeks ago anyway
May 5, 2015, 10:43 AM
Callum Davies
Sorry, meant to say did NOT know that 
May 5, 2015, 10:42 AM
George Hughes
Sure you did 
May 5, 2015, 10:42 AM
George Hughes
Funnily enough, the BBC describes Colin Meloy as being erudite
May 5, 2015, 10:42 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh, did know that
May 5, 2015, 10:41 AM
George Hughes
Newton I beg your pardon
May 5, 2015, 10:41 AM
George Hughes
Nope, it's a very rare synonym for greatly intelligent and intrigued about how things work, basically just a word to describe Albert Einstein or Isaac Newcastle
May 5, 2015, 10:41 AM
Callum Davies
It's a made-up sci-fi word isn't it?
May 5, 2015, 10:39 AM
George Hughes
If you can 
May 5, 2015, 10:38 AM
George Hughes
Well you're pretty close with that, but what really got me were the names of the factions; erudite for example, define that?
May 5, 2015, 10:38 AM
Callum Davies
Teenage girls seem to like that sort of stuff, so the author just thought "I'll write exactly the same thing, but change it slightly so nobody will notice, and make loads of money!!!" 
May 5, 2015, 10:37 AM
George Hughes
I've googled it and yeah, hunger games came first. I like to use the word inspired rather than copy of course 
May 5, 2015, 10:35 AM
Callum Davies
The book was a copy of the hunger games! 
May 5, 2015, 10:34 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha nah it's based on a book that I'm sure was written before hunger games
May 5, 2015, 10:34 AM
Callum Davies
Nah, it was just a shameless copy of the hunger games
May 5, 2015, 10:34 AM
George Hughes
Really, you didn't like it?
May 5, 2015, 10:33 AM
Callum Davies
I've seen it, it's just the hunger games, but worse
May 5, 2015, 10:33 AM
George Hughes
Sort of like hunger games but seemingly more relaxed
May 5, 2015, 10:33 AM
George Hughes
It's called divergent and it's a sort of dystopia Sci Fi romance thingy, it was very good but there was a little too much romance for a Sci Fi film
May 5, 2015, 10:32 AM
Callum Davies
What was the film you were watching yesterday?
May 5, 2015, 10:32 AM
George Hughes
Noooooo!
May 5, 2015, 10:31 AM
Callum Davies
There's a glitch in the Matrix!
May 5, 2015, 10:31 AM
George Hughes
Yeah, I do that a lot as well
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
George Hughes
Looks like you're good to go
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
Callum Davies
Maybe i misheard, I tend to do that... A lot 
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
George Hughes
01000001 01101000 01101000 01101000 01101000 01101000
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
George Hughes
Say ahhhh
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
George Hughes
Computing, but maybe I did, and if I did, then I need to see a doctor to confirm my brain is functioning adequately for said exam
May 5, 2015, 10:29 AM
Callum Davies
Didn't you say you had a history exam tomorrow?
May 5, 2015, 10:28 AM
George Hughes
Probably why*
May 5, 2015, 10:28 AM
George Hughes
Probably, I don't know much history  probably I didn't do too good last year in nat 5
May 5, 2015, 10:28 AM
Callum Davies
There isn't a sixth reich, the Third Reich was disbanded after WWII wasn't it?
May 5, 2015, 10:27 AM
George Hughes
Not that I brutally murdered all the staff in the history department
May 5, 2015, 10:26 AM
George Hughes
And my history class is in the past, because it is no longer present
May 5, 2015, 10:26 AM
George Hughes
And I'll have you know it was the Rise of the Sixth Reich or Something
May 5, 2015, 10:25 AM
Callum Davies
How does that work? The past is always history unless it somehow moves to the future...
May 5, 2015, 10:25 AM
George Hughes
It was but no longer is 
May 5, 2015, 10:24 AM
George Hughes
Ahh but you see my friend, my history class is history...
May 5, 2015, 10:24 AM
Callum Davies
But that's the future, and then the recent past. Should you not be revising the rise of the Third Reich or something 
May 5, 2015, 10:23 AM
George Hughes
Brits *
May 5, 2015, 10:23 AM
George Hughes
XD
May 5, 2015, 10:22 AM
George Hughes
History hmm? I'm focusing mainly on this Thursday, which I believe is a very important day;the general election in which the big parties go down. It was a big day for the bits
May 5, 2015, 10:22 AM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, fair enough. What part of history are you revising?
May 5, 2015, 10:21 AM
George Hughes
I don't mind, I can revise and chat simultaneously considering our conversations are usually fairly educated
May 5, 2015, 10:20 AM
Callum Davies
Yea, alright. I'll leave you to revise if you want...
May 5, 2015, 10:19 AM
George Hughes
Damn, I can chat here for a while if you're bored?
May 5, 2015, 10:19 AM
Callum Davies
12:45, never mind, I'm just bored! 
May 5, 2015, 10:18 AM
George Hughes
Nah sorry, when's your exam?
May 5, 2015, 10:18 AM
Callum Davies
Are you in school today?
May 5, 2015, 10:17 AM
George Hughes

Callum Davies
Yuh sure, can you just drop me text when you're ready, I turn my WiFi off when I'm not using it to save battery.
May 4, 2015, 6:08 PM
George Hughes
I can't go on Skype just now, but maybe in an hour or so once mum's back and we've had tea
May 4, 2015, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies

May 4, 2015, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies
Yea sure, wanna arrange it on Skype just now?
May 4, 2015, 6:07 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, if you've got an idea of music for all of them, or if they're spoofs, then yeah and I can autotune your voice as well  want to meet up some time before the maths exam?
May 4, 2015, 6:04 PM
Callum Davies
We should arrange to meet up for revision sometime over study leave
May 4, 2015, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
You may be aware that I have now written three comedy songs, and if I can put a tune to it, a fourth. We should maybe get together and record them for my channel! 
May 4, 2015, 5:23 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, thanks
May 4, 2015, 4:56 PM
George Hughes
That's really cool! I like it, well done! I don't give a... XD
May 4, 2015, 12:37 PM
Callum Davies
Wrote a new comedy song, could you tell me what you think? Thanks :)

Well, is there anything you absolutely need to do, nobody else will be there, trust me. I just went into drama, and the teacher asked why we there. None of the teachers are expecting people to come.
Apr 30, 2015, 12:42 PM
George Hughes

Apr 30, 2015, 12:40 PM

Callum Davies

Jan 5, 2015, 11:03 PM
George Hughes
I don't, but I can easily learn it, the chords look easy
Jan 5, 2015, 11:02 PM
Callum Davies

Jan 5, 2015, 11:02 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, it doesn't need to be perfect. And haha woohoo
Jan 5, 2015, 11:01 PM
Callum Davies

George Hughes
Haha cool, gotta go, I might be back in a bit
Jan 5, 2015, 9:12 PM
Callum Davies
ha ha, well that's the full song, i've told you the last line
Jan 5, 2015, 9:12 PM
George Hughes
That's what it did haha
Jan 5, 2015, 9:11 PM
George Hughes

Jan 5, 2015, 9:11 PM
Callum Davies
that's the line, but the C is at "need"
Jan 5, 2015, 9:11 PM
Callum Davies
C
Then you need to fight it!
Jan 5, 2015, 9:11 PM
George Hughes
Haha my computer did last time, now it's my ipad that's doing it
Jan 5, 2015, 9:10 PM
Callum Davies
your computer is cutting the last line off all of my documents
Jan 5, 2015, 9:10 PM
George Hughes
Oh right, the version you sent me missed out that last bit haha
Jan 5, 2015, 9:09 PM
Callum Davies
the line is cuz if you do like it/ then you need to fight it"
Jan 5, 2015, 9:09 PM
Callum Davies
but it is, wait a minute
Jan 5, 2015, 9:08 PM
George Hughes
Haha good idea, but I think if you're saying cause, then you need to finish the sentence 
Jan 5, 2015, 9:08 PM
Callum Davies
yea maybe, that's acually a line from the song, i thought it would be clever to samople at least one, see who noticed
Jan 5, 2015, 9:07 PM
George Hughes
Cuz if you do not like it
Jan 5, 2015, 9:07 PM
George Hughes
I like it, but I feel the last line is a little abrupt?? [?]
Jan 5, 2015, 9:06 PM
Callum Davies
it's simpe but fast
Jan 5, 2015, 9:05 PM
Callum Davies

Jan 5, 2015, 9:03 PM
Callum Davies
well, i've written a satrical take on 2014 in the basis of a song, based off billy joel's "we didn't light the fire" which i'm going to ask the friday live team if i can "sing" it at one of them, and i need a guitarist
Jan 5, 2015, 9:02 PM

Sheesh! That's a lot!
Dec 31, 2014, 12:28 AM
Callum Davies
cheers :) he's still got tonnes more articles though, but i can't analyse them all, i had a look, he's written something like 655 atricles in all for the guardian
Dec 31, 2014, 12:27 AM
George Hughes
Cool, well done!

Dec 30, 2014, 4:15 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, that makes sense, if you want to do something, do it right, eh ;-)
Dec 30, 2014, 4:13 PM
Callum Davies
but we can't go start from writng the script to recordng it, if you wouldn't mind i'd like to spend a bit of time with the script, working out how i'm gunna say my lines, and developing my character. I plan on doing this properly :P
Dec 30, 2014, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, that sounds cool!
Dec 30, 2014, 4:12 PM
Callum Davies
sounds like a plan, have a session in the studio! as for the storyline, i could help you with that if you need, we could have a few writing sessions over skype and batter out a script together
Dec 30, 2014, 4:11 PM
George Hughes
I'd probably need a full storyline before I can even begin the programming, and I'll record you with my condenser ;-)

sounds like fun, would you need input on the script, or would you just write it, send it to me, then i'd record my lines and send the voice files to you?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:09 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, that would be cool, I'm not great at first person or third person but I can work on that
Dec 30, 2014, 4:08 PM
Callum Davies
ohhh, i dunno, you're the genius with the ideas, i'd just be reading from a script recording lines. how about a good old-fashioned zombie game?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
Yeah man, that would be awesome! If you've got any ideas for games that would need that, I'd be happy to take a look
Dec 30, 2014, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
well, i've wanting to get into voice-acting, and that is mainly done in anmation and games, which you do. so, i was thinking, if you ever created a game that needed someone to voice a charcter, i could maybe do it?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, what's up?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:04 PM
Callum Davies
could you maybe help me out with something?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:04 PM
George Hughes
Cool! And yeah, it was good thanks
Dec 30, 2014, 4:03 PM

Apr 29, 2014, 6:26 PM
Callum Davies
i've been watching them back and they're a bit racy at times, said some things i didn't want to say, so i'll probably think twice before uploading them
Apr 29, 2014, 4:52 PM
George Hughes
By the way, when are you uploading those silly minecraft videos?
Apr 29, 2014, 2:31 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 18, 2014, 1:13 PM
George Hughes
You can get a behringer delay/echo for around ¬£20 but let me just check...
Apr 18, 2014, 1:12 PM
Callum Davies
well if you think i'm learning too fast i suppose i could slow down a bit! lol. that's a pretty good idea, i've been looking at things for my b'day, i havent really had any ideas yet, so thanks! by the by, how much money are we looking at?
Apr 18, 2014, 1:11 PM
George Hughes
See if you can get a cheap delay pedal cause tapping sounds amazing with delay!
Apr 18, 2014, 1:09 PM
Callum Davies
slow, but nice. i'll practice and eventually get faster so i can sound like Blackmore! :P
Apr 18, 2014, 1:09 PM
George Hughes
Great! How's it sounding then?
Apr 18, 2014, 1:08 PM
Callum Davies
ha ha, that's good news! oh btw, i've been learning how to do guitar tapping
Apr 18, 2014, 1:07 PM

Apr 18, 2014, 1:02 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 18, 2014, 1:02 PM
George Hughes
Cool! Have you ever heard of Virtual Dub? It's video editing software and it supports some of the greatest codecs out there! You should look into it.
Apr 18, 2014, 1:01 PM
Callum Davies
54% exported, then after that i'll have to upload it, that will probably be an overnight job
Apr 18, 2014, 1:00 PM
George Hughes
Haha! Best one yet! How's the videos coming along?
Apr 18, 2014, 1:00 PM
Callum Davies
well i suppose you could also chuck it out a plane at 40,000 feet, and have a dell skyfall
Apr 18, 2014, 12:58 PM
Callum Davies

George Hughes

Apr 18, 2014, 12:52 PM
Callum Davies

With an acoustic i can do a bit! But rock and roll is really just rock blues
Feb 27, 2014, 10:04 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 27, 2014, 10:03 PM
George Hughes
I can do a wee bit o' jazz and with a bass i can do all kinds o' funky funk rythm!
Feb 27, 2014, 10:03 PM
Callum Davies
oh could you maybe learn a different style of riff. maybe jazz or rock or funk or whatever. give a bit of differnce from blues
Feb 27, 2014, 10:02 PM

Feb 27, 2014, 9:58 PM

Callum Davies

Feb 27, 2014, 9:57 PM
George Hughes

Feb 27, 2014, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 27, 2014, 9:55 PM
George Hughes

Feb 27, 2014, 9:54 PM

Feb 27, 2014, 9:54 PM

Feb 27, 2014, 9:53 PM
Callum Davies
ohhh! i'm sure it's not permenant for you though. couple days r&r and you'll be good as new, i'm sure!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
Haha, I know, Mum says I shouldn't be lifting heavy weights without the string muscle cause that's what caused her permanent back damage when she was younger
Feb 27, 2014, 9:51 PM
Callum Davies
hah, idiot! are you ok? (and yes, it does have to be in that order, it's the law!)
Feb 27, 2014, 9:50 PM
George Hughes
Playing guitar, managed to pull a muscle in my back and give myself a stitch moving chairs at Rock Challenge :-s

Feb 27, 2014, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
yea, it'll still be suprise for everyone else though. they think its just me, tell mr kelman not to put it in the bulliten or anything, just pout it down as me
Feb 27, 2014, 9:47 PM
George Hughes
I agree but then it might be classed as unfair so i'll check with Mr Kelman anyway. It will be fun though!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:47 PM
Callum Davies
hah, no! let's keep it a suprise!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Yeah if you want! But i'll need to check with Mr Kelman if i'm allowed to come up twice!

A cloud is a real thing. Its either a network where clients can upload data eg youtube or ICloud or it is a collection of evaporated H20. :-P
Feb 27, 2014, 9:42 PM
Callum Davies
i thought that was the cloud. well you learn something new every day!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:41 PM
George Hughes
The ether is the name for a figurative space where all the internet is stored! It isn't real though.
Feb 27, 2014, 9:40 PM

Callum Davies

Feb 24, 2014, 6:57 PM
George Hughes
But that doesn't make sense, indespensible what?
Feb 24, 2014, 6:56 PM
Callum Davies
trust me it's a compliment!
Feb 24, 2014, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
Indispensable what?
Feb 24, 2014, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
because your my best friend and you've always been there for me and your indispensible
Feb 24, 2014, 6:54 PM
George Hughes

Hi
Feb 24, 2014, 6:53 PM
Callum Davies
hi george
Feb 24, 2014, 6:53 PM
Callum Davies
i could really do with telling her how i feel, could you do me a massive favour and ask her to give me a call after tea?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:57 PM
George Hughes
Bye!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:56 PM
Callum Davies
ok then, bye
Feb 24, 2014, 5:56 PM
George Hughes
I gotta go for tea now so i'll see you later!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:55 PM
Callum Davies
i genuinly think this will take a lot of time, she really hurt me george. but what you gunna do, she's always been the one who wears the trousers
Feb 24, 2014, 5:55 PM
George Hughes
That's being pessimistic again. It won't take long till you feel back to normal/better again
Feb 24, 2014, 5:53 PM
Callum Davies
ohhh, i dunno about a week, a few months minimum i think
Feb 24, 2014, 5:53 PM
George Hughes
I took time with me too but i felt better within a week so i'm sure you'll feel better soon as well!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:52 PM
Callum Davies
better, but not my usual self, thx for helping but i think it will take time to heal this wound for it is deep
Feb 24, 2014, 5:51 PM
George Hughes
That's fine! How are you feeling now then?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:50 PM
Callum Davies
dont need to be now, just whenever is fine
Feb 24, 2014, 5:50 PM
George Hughes
I dunno, i'll see.
Feb 24, 2014, 5:50 PM
Callum Davies
not for you! i remener you said that! i mean for mum dad and zoe
Feb 24, 2014, 5:49 PM
George Hughes
That might be fun to go see a comedian live, i've never been to a live performance! And i said a month or so back that i wasn't really interested in the ceilidh no offense
Feb 24, 2014, 5:49 PM
Callum Davies
tell me if i'm wrong
Feb 24, 2014, 5:48 PM
Callum Davies
a comedian, and we had bought the family tickets for the ceildh on march 8th, but i expect your not going since yesterday
Feb 24, 2014, 5:47 PM
George Hughes
Ceildh. But whose Ross Noble?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:46 PM
Callum Davies
the ceildh or ross noble?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:46 PM
George Hughes
I don't know, is this the thing you were talking about a while back?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:45 PM
Callum Davies
oh incidently, do you know where we stand with the ceildh tickets? also, do you fancy going to see ross noble with me at october?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:44 PM
George Hughes
?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:43 PM
Callum Davies
hello?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:43 PM
George Hughes
Love is a great thing, but as November Rain states: "Nothing lasts forever"
Feb 24, 2014, 5:43 PM
Callum Davies
as barry manilow said: the moral of this story - don't fall in love
Feb 24, 2014, 5:42 PM
Callum Davies
can she not understand my pain though, i mean she seemed pretty upset at the thought of it on thurs, but i dont know neither me nor you are zoe, i wont be ready to love again for a very long time
Feb 24, 2014, 5:42 PM
George Hughes
That's just my input but as I said you're whole life is ahead of you so you will find and give plenty of love and get you're heart broken many more times. As will I!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:40 PM
Callum Davies
maybe, that's what she said. thx, but i dont want pretty girls, i dont want "groupies" i want love, and i'm not sure if im gunna be able to find it again
Feb 24, 2014, 5:39 PM
George Hughes
I don't know, i'm not Zo√´. But remember you still have your whole life to lead! You'll meet many a pretty girls and if it's meant to be, you might get back together when you're older!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:38 PM
Callum Davies
well i feel like i have done nothing but give her love attention and support, and she pays me back like this. also, you know what happened on thrusday when she was upset and we broke up, and then she got back together with me because "it didn't feel right being apart". so that would indictae to me that she wants to be with me, so i'm just so confused as to why the sudden change of heart in about a week
Feb 24, 2014, 5:36 PM
George Hughes
You there?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:36 PM
George Hughes
Shoot away :-)
Feb 24, 2014, 5:34 PM
Callum Davies
will do, but first, can i tell you why i feel confused?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:33 PM
George Hughes
Run cold water over them then :-)
Feb 24, 2014, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
oww my knuckles hurt!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:32 PM
George Hughes
Apoligise for it and tell her why you have been angry, sit down for 30 minutes and chat about life and you're mum is the best person to talk to because she will have experience life.
Feb 24, 2014, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
that's gunna be expensive to fix, mum's gunna kill me!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
ive learnt that communication doesnt work! and i'm not proud of this but i just got so angry i punched a dent in my wall
Feb 24, 2014, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
Complaining won't get you anywhere, if you think negative, negative will occur. If you are having family issues communicate with them and all will be well!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:29 PM
Callum Davies
but what about when nothing goes right, and while dad is in sunderland mum is usually stressed, which means that her and me argue on a near daily basis! you call that loving?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:28 PM
George Hughes
Life is exactly that which is why the only way to go is to look at the good things in it otherwise you will end up depressed.
Feb 24, 2014, 5:27 PM
Callum Davies
listen, right now the last thing i need is your relentless optimism, right now i need care and advice, becuase i have learnt somthing, that the world is unfair and that life is just one long slug of useless events and then you die!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:26 PM
George Hughes
Wow, pessimistic, at least you still have a loving family with two parents! Think how many people at our school don't!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:25 PM
Callum Davies
well it seems fitting that everything i love should disappear
Feb 24, 2014, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
Aww why?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:24 PM
Callum Davies
oh i'm giving up on the comedy as well
Feb 24, 2014, 5:23 PM
George Hughes
Well of course you'd feel a little down but look on the bright side, you could use this experience for something maybe a comedy routine, maybe a poem! It's all a learning experience! :-)
Feb 24, 2014, 5:23 PM
Callum Davies
hello?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:22 PM
Callum Davies
think really hard about it, given what just happened to me, how do you think i would feel?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:21 PM
George Hughes
I can't see you so i'm unable to tell
Feb 24, 2014, 5:21 PM
Callum Davies
what do you think?

Callum Davies
that's nothing against you, it's just how your mind works
May 15, 2013, 8:16 PM
Callum Davies
oh no i mean why it didnt work on you. it's because you have a very logical brain, you didnt think that you could move the bolt with ur mind, so you created a mental block making it impossible for you to
May 15, 2013, 8:16 PM
George Hughes
Am i right?
May 15, 2013, 8:15 PM
George Hughes
When you think about doing something, your brain automatically makes you do it on a small scale. Ideomotor!
