Quite often when you talk about liking someone in Japanese, you'd say ‰∫∫„ÅÆ„Åì„Å® where ‰∫∫ is the specific person. It means something along the lines of "about them"
Oct 23, 2019, 2:10 PM

I've tried rubbing them, and I've tried bicarbonate of soda
Oct 2, 2019, 3:06 PM
Zoe Hughes
Also warm olive oil is meant to hel0
Oct 2, 2019, 3:04 PM
Zoe Hughes
Rub them a little

Oct 1, 2019, 11:58 AM
George Hughes
So just learn one pattern at a time
Oct 1, 2019, 11:57 AM

Sep 27, 2019, 4:40 PM

Sep 27, 2019, 4:37 PM

Sep 27, 2019, 4:37 PM
Zoe Hughes
I've found a bus
Sep 27, 2019, 4:29 PM
George Hughes
I think they run pretty late anyways
Sep 27, 2019, 4:29 PM
Zoe Hughes
Just in the dooor
Sep 27, 2019, 4:17 PM
Zoe Hughes
Not yet
Sep 27, 2019, 4:17 PM
George Hughes
Have you look at bus times yet?
Sep 27, 2019, 4:16 PM
Zoe Hughes
Not sure yet
Sep 27, 2019, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
What time are you going yo Brig?
Sep 27, 2019, 3:02 PM
George Hughes
You'll never need to know it
Sep 27, 2019, 3:02 PM
Zoe Hughes
I sorta get it now
Sep 27, 2019, 1:54 PM
George Hughes
The idea is that you can adjust the weights until until you get the desired output for a certain input
Sep 27, 2019, 1:06 PM
George Hughes
Kinda like a flow chart yep
Sep 27, 2019, 1:06 PM
Zoe Hughes
Or more of a flow chart of multiplications
Sep 27, 2019, 1:04 PM
Zoe Hughes
So it's sorta like a Web of functions?
Sep 27, 2019, 1:03 PM
George Hughes
Then you gotta squish them
Sep 27, 2019, 1:02 PM
George Hughes
Once you have all those multiplied numbers, you just add them together
Sep 27, 2019, 1:02 PM
George Hughes
And to decide the value for a node in the next layer, you look at all the blue lines that feed into it, then for each one multiply the value at the node on the other end of that blue line by the weight value I mentioned
Sep 27, 2019, 1:01 PM
George Hughes
Any old value
Sep 27, 2019, 1:00 PM
George Hughes
The input nodes start with some value
Sep 27, 2019, 1:00 PM
George Hughes
Those weights have a certain value associated with them
Sep 27, 2019, 1:00 PM
Zoe Hughes
I see
Sep 27, 2019, 12:59 PM
George Hughes
Each of the blue lines is called a weight, each of the black circles is called a node
Sep 27, 2019, 12:58 PM
George Hughes

Sep 27, 2019, 12:58 PM
George Hughes
Lemme draw it for you
Sep 27, 2019, 12:55 PM
Zoe Hughes
Right
Sep 27, 2019, 12:55 PM
George Hughes
Then the nodes of that layer are used as input for the next layer and so on
Sep 27, 2019, 12:54 PM
George Hughes
Each input number gets sent to the next layer and is multiplied by the weight of the connection between the input node and the corresponding node of that layer
Sep 27, 2019, 12:54 PM
George Hughes
Basically, you've got a bunch of input numbers
Sep 27, 2019, 12:53 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'm trying to understand
Sep 27, 2019, 12:52 PM
George Hughes
A graph of nodes connected by weights which feeds an input through a network and to receive an output based on weights and activation functions
Sep 27, 2019, 12:52 PM

Everything is on a spectrum these days
üòÜGeorge Hughes
Sep 23, 2019, 2:59 PM
George Hughes
Nouns and adjectives are more of a spectrum in Japanese lol
Sep 23, 2019, 2:58 PM
George Hughes
And some particular adjectives too
Sep 23, 2019, 2:58 PM
George Hughes
And you can do that with any noun
Sep 23, 2019, 2:58 PM
Zoe Hughes
I hadn't thought of it in thay way before
Sep 23, 2019, 2:57 PM
Zoe Hughes
Rather than writing a whole load about ownership and explaing with words
Sep 23, 2019, 2:57 PM

Once you know what direction each vowel sound is in it'll be easy
Sep 23, 2019, 2:53 PM
George Hughes
And it suggests all the relevant kanji should you choose to use it
Sep 23, 2019, 2:53 PM
George Hughes
It's really efficient once you get the hang of it

We had them quite recently
Jun 30, 2019, 2:14 PM
Zoe Hughes
They're like a peppery lettuce thing
Jun 30, 2019, 2:13 PM
Zoe Hughes
Chinese leaves are nice

Jun 30, 2019, 2:11 PM

You know, lettuce, tomatoes, vinegar...
Jun 30, 2019, 2:11 PM
Zoe Hughes

Jun 30, 2019, 2:11 PM

Jun 30, 2019, 11:36 AM
Zoe Hughes
Aye
Jun 30, 2019, 11:35 AM
George Hughes
You may well be here at that point so we can decide then
Jun 30, 2019, 11:34 AM
Zoe Hughes
Add the cream then
Jun 30, 2019, 11:34 AM
George Hughes
But with the cream is really really good in my opinion
Jun 30, 2019, 11:33 AM
George Hughes
It's up to you, it'll come out differently with the different spices no doubt
Jun 30, 2019, 11:32 AM
Zoe Hughes
Would it be nice without cream or maybe I should trust you're cooking, you know this dish better than I do
Jun 30, 2019, 11:32 AM
George Hughes
So no cream or boiled off cream?
Jun 30, 2019, 11:31 AM
Zoe Hughes
I'm more of a thin liquid sauce kinda person when it comes to meat
Jun 30, 2019, 11:30 AM
George Hughes
If you leave it in for longer, it becomes sorta oily and that's really nice too
Jun 30, 2019, 11:29 AM
Zoe Hughes
Ok
Jun 30, 2019, 11:29 AM
George Hughes
Put double cream in near the end and it makes it really nice,
Jun 30, 2019, 11:29 AM
Zoe Hughes
Creamy?
Jun 30, 2019, 11:28 AM
George Hughes
I'm thinking creamy tomato sauces for both porks, with soy sauce and brown sugar
Jun 30, 2019, 11:27 AM
Zoe Hughes

Jun 30, 2019, 11:27 AM
George Hughes
Great, sorted!

Jun 30, 2019, 11:24 AM
George Hughes
And I'll put kidney beans through the sauce that the thebpotk boils in
Jun 30, 2019, 11:24 AM
George Hughes
For sides, I'm thinking a pot of rice and sliced red onions in melted honey
Jun 30, 2019, 11:23 AM
Zoe Hughes
Sounds good to me
Jun 30, 2019, 11:22 AM
George Hughes
And pepper
Jun 30, 2019, 11:22 AM
George Hughes
The mild ones will have 5 spice, ginger, touch of paprika, basil and ground garlic
Jun 30, 2019, 11:22 AM
George Hughes
I was thinking about spices for pork, I'm gonna do one set of fairly spicy ones which you're welcome to try some of, and one set of mild ones
Jun 30, 2019, 11:21 AM
Zoe Hughes
Aye

If the neighbourhood is already in a state of doom you can alleviate this, bringing great honour to your family

Yes
Jun 16, 2019, 7:51 PM

In general, the active voice makes your writing stronger, more direct, and, you guessed it, more active. The subject is something, or it does the action of the verb in the sentence. With the passive voice, the subject is acted upon by some other performer of the verb. (In case you weren‚Äôt paying attention, the previous two sentences use the type of voice they describe.)

Dear Ms ,

I was wondering if it would be possible to get a digital copy of the IT assignment and if I could submit it to you digitally.

Due to the staff strikes this week and an absence last week due to health reasons, I haven't been sure what needs to be done but I would still like to complete the work.

Please let me know if the above is possible and what the best way forward would be.

Kind regards,
Zo√´

May 7, 2019, 3:53 PM

What do you think?
May 7, 2019, 3:53 PM
George Hughes
Or shall we leave early and get the 3am one?
May 7, 2019, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
And we'll get the 4am bus after the party?
May 7, 2019, 3:51 PM

True
May 7, 2019, 3:51 PM

That bus allows for any delays
May 7, 2019, 3:51 PM

May 7, 2019, 3:01 PM

Then we'll need to leave at just before 2
May 6, 2019, 10:21 PM

May 6, 2019, 10:06 PM
George Hughes
Let me know what you think
May 6, 2019, 10:01 PM
George Hughes
Right here's a rough game plan
May 6, 2019, 10:00 PM
George Hughes

May 6, 2019, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
Great
May 6, 2019, 9:59 PM
Zoe Hughes
He says that's fine
May 6, 2019, 9:51 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'll ask, I'm sure he wouldn't mind
May 6, 2019, 9:51 PM
George Hughes
Think Dad could drive us up to the Perth bus station?
May 6, 2019, 9:37 PM
George Hughes
The one before that takes us into Glasgow at 8:15
May 6, 2019, 9:37 PM
George Hughes
That gives us half an hour til the start of the party
May 6, 2019, 9:36 PM
Zoe Hughes
Would that be ok?
May 6, 2019, 9:36 PM
George Hughes
The 7:50 one from the Perth bus station then?
May 6, 2019, 9:35 PM
Zoe Hughes
It would be better to have a little time to spare
May 6, 2019, 9:34 PM
George Hughes
Which one? Or sooner?
May 6, 2019, 9:32 PM
George Hughes

May 6, 2019, 9:32 PM
George Hughes
We'll need to get a bus from Broxden
May 6, 2019, 9:32 PM
Zoe Hughes
Hmm
May 6, 2019, 9:32 PM
George Hughes
The party starts at 10, what time do you want to arrive in Glasgow?
May 6, 2019, 9:31 PM
George Hughes
That's good, we can look after each other
May 6, 2019, 9:31 PM
Zoe Hughes
He seems okay with us going
May 6, 2019, 9:31 PM
Zoe Hughes
And I told dad
May 6, 2019, 9:30 PM
Zoe Hughes
Mum suggested it
May 6, 2019, 9:30 PM
George Hughes
Keep quiet on how much we're spending though, they might not like to hear :p
May 6, 2019, 9:08 PM
George Hughes
Have you told Mum and Dad what we're planning?
May 6, 2019, 9:07 PM
George Hughes
Good good, you'll remember it better that way
May 6, 2019, 9:07 PM
Zoe Hughes
Don't worry, I have no intention if drinking much
May 6, 2019, 9:06 PM
George Hughes
Not to drink too much if we're doing this though, gotta be ready for the journey the next day
May 6, 2019, 9:04 PM
George Hughes
I've gotta cook some dinner, then I've got a couple bits and bobs to do, then I'll sit down and look at tickets properly
May 6, 2019, 9:03 PM
George Hughes
If you're willing, I'm willing
May 6, 2019, 9:02 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'm willing to spend on it, well have fun so it'll be worth it
May 6, 2019, 9:01 PM
George Hughes
I can count it up properly once I'm in the door
May 6, 2019, 8:50 PM
George Hughes
I'm going to estimate we'll be paying around ¬£75 each total
May 6, 2019, 8:50 PM
George Hughes
Between us, the transport from Glasgow to Hereford is going to be over ¬£100,and we'll still have to add in transport from Perth to Glasgow and the entrance fee for the party
May 6, 2019, 8:48 PM
George Hughes
It's gonna be very pricy
May 6, 2019, 8:47 PM
George Hughes
We'll arrive in Hereford at half 7pm
May 6, 2019, 8:43 PM
George Hughes
Okay if we leave Edinburgh just before 3pm, we can get to a train to Crewe then get another train from there to Hereford
May 6, 2019, 8:43 PM
George Hughes
And no probs
May 6, 2019, 8:41 PM
George Hughes
Okie dokie
May 6, 2019, 8:41 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'm gonna go dry some dishes real quick
May 6, 2019, 8:40 PM

Thank you
May 6, 2019, 8:40 PM
Zoe Hughes
Ok
May 6, 2019, 8:40 PM
George Hughes
Let me check trains from Edi
May 6, 2019, 8:40 PM
George Hughes
Great
May 6, 2019, 8:40 PM
Zoe Hughes
Yupp
May 6, 2019, 8:39 PM
George Hughes
So the party is on the 18th and runs til 3am on the 19th yeah?
May 6, 2019, 8:39 PM
George Hughes
Then there lies the problem of getting from Edinburgh to Hereford in the afternoon
May 6, 2019, 8:39 PM
George Hughes
I'm fine with that if you are
May 6, 2019, 8:38 PM
Zoe Hughes
I think we could manage the walk. If that's the most plausible way to do it.
May 6, 2019, 8:38 PM
George Hughes
Whatchu think so far?
May 6, 2019, 8:37 PM
George Hughes
But bear in mind we'll be tired after lots of dancing and travelling
May 6, 2019, 8:37 PM
George Hughes
Which is a 20 minute walk
May 6, 2019, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
Unless we got a bus to the university and walked to the house
May 6, 2019, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
I'd suggest going to my house but the buses from Edinburgh center to Currie don't run until 5/6ish so we'd be stuck in town for at least an hour
May 6, 2019, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
But then the trains to get us to Hereford won't be until late in the day
May 6, 2019, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
The only transport from Glasgow when the party finishes is to Edinburgh
May 6, 2019, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
I've done a bit of searching and I'm struggling to find anything that's going to suit us.
May 6, 2019, 8:34 PM
Zoe Hughes
Car city
May 6, 2019, 8:29 PM
Zoe Hughes
Yes
May 6, 2019, 8:29 PM
George Hughes
Brum brum
May 6, 2019, 8:27 PM
Zoe Hughes
Birmingham
May 6, 2019, 8:27 PM
George Hughes
What's the next transfer location after Edinburgh?
May 6, 2019, 8:25 PM
George Hughes
I'm pretty sure the 900 runs between Glasgow and Edinburgh at all hours
May 6, 2019, 8:25 PM
George Hughes
Could check for buses to one of the transfer locations in the early hours
May 6, 2019, 8:25 PM
George Hughes
The party goes until 3,and the first train is at 8 so we'd either need some way to kill the time or a place to stay
May 6, 2019, 8:24 PM
Zoe Hughes
*don't think
May 6, 2019, 8:23 PM
Zoe Hughes
Soon contention they do
May 6, 2019, 8:23 PM
Zoe Hughes
Google didn't throw up any
May 6, 2019, 8:23 PM
George Hughes
They surely don't run after midnight
May 6, 2019, 8:21 PM
George Hughes
Okay, but what times?
May 6, 2019, 8:21 PM
Zoe Hughes
for the ones with 3 trains
May 6, 2019, 8:20 PM
Zoe Hughes
According to Google yes
May 6, 2019, 8:20 PM
George Hughes
So the first transfer would be at Edinburgh?
May 6, 2019, 8:19 PM
Zoe Hughes
But there's loads of timetables of trains from Glasgow to Edinburgh
May 6, 2019, 8:18 PM
Zoe Hughes
The first train Google suggests is one to Edinburgh waverly
May 6, 2019, 8:18 PM
George Hughes
Or is it for days of the week?
May 6, 2019, 8:17 PM
George Hughes
Well are they dated?
May 6, 2019, 8:17 PM
Zoe Hughes
I've found timetables but I'm not sure which I need to look at
May 6, 2019, 8:15 PM
George Hughes
Hmmm
May 6, 2019, 7:46 PM
George Hughes
Enjoy your dinner
May 6, 2019, 7:46 PM
Zoe Hughes
The website isn't making it easy to just view a time table tho
May 6, 2019, 7:44 PM
Zoe Hughes
Twas just come out the oven so I'll have to check after
May 6, 2019, 7:44 PM
George Hughes
Let me know what you see
May 6, 2019, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
Yeah me neither, I think it'd be asking a lot
May 6, 2019, 7:43 PM
Zoe Hughes
I think that should be out last option, I wouldn't want to inconvenience him
May 6, 2019, 7:41 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'm going to look at train timetables
May 6, 2019, 7:40 PM
George Hughes
Then get a train the next day
May 6, 2019, 7:36 PM
George Hughes
I could possibly ask Ruairidh if we could crash at his after the party
May 6, 2019, 7:35 PM
George Hughes
Know any other trip planning sites?
May 6, 2019, 7:34 PM
Zoe Hughes
Maybe there's a better way than Google
May 6, 2019, 6:26 PM
George Hughes
Same
May 6, 2019, 6:06 PM
Zoe Hughes
The fewest number of trains I've found I s 3
May 6, 2019, 6:06 PM
Zoe Hughes
Yeah
May 6, 2019, 6:06 PM
George Hughes
Seems like there's a lot of transfers
May 6, 2019, 6:06 PM
George Hughes
I'll look into it once I'm home anyways
May 6, 2019, 6:05 PM
Zoe Hughes

May 6, 2019, 5:00 PM
Zoe Hughes
Hmm
May 6, 2019, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
I had a quick look and nothing came up
May 6, 2019, 4:59 PM
Zoe Hughes
I can't find anything over night using Google's train thingo
May 6, 2019, 4:56 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'll check google
May 6, 2019, 4:52 PM
George Hughes
Think we could get an overnight train from Glasgow to Hereford?
May 6, 2019, 4:51 PM
Zoe Hughes

May 6, 2019, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
I'll check once I'm home this evening
May 6, 2019, 4:45 PM
Zoe Hughes
We can look it up
May 6, 2019, 4:43 PM
George Hughes
Let me think on it, how expensive do you think it'd be?
May 6, 2019, 4:43 PM
Zoe Hughes
Yup
May 6, 2019, 4:42 PM
George Hughes
I'm just thinking, we could get a train couldn't we
May 6, 2019, 4:42 PM
Zoe Hughes
How would you feel about doing that?
May 6, 2019, 4:41 PM
Zoe Hughes
Mum says we can go to the bubble pop party if we find out own transport to Hereford
May 6, 2019, 4:35 PM
Zoe Hughes
Yeah I do
May 6, 2019, 4:34 PM

Look at the facial expressions of the guy on the left in the group dance
May 6, 2019, 12:45 AM
George Hughes
In all honesty I don't really like it, the reason I like vocaloid so much is cause it's all so harmonically rich. But this just seems a touch bland, which is ironic

Zoe Hughes
I've never seen all 4 sing together
May 5, 2019, 11:14 PM
George Hughes
It's possibly from a music video
May 5, 2019, 11:12 PM
George Hughes
Yeah understandably there's no solid character
May 5, 2019, 11:11 PM
Zoe Hughes
But all in getting is that there are some unofficial mangas
May 5, 2019, 11:11 PM
Zoe Hughes
I've searched vocaloid anime to see if there's any information on it
May 5, 2019, 11:11 PM

May 5, 2019, 8:56 PM
George Hughes
That's probsbly why it's such a good song, because it stands out
May 5, 2019, 8:55 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I think you're right, the song does its own thing for its own reasons and repetition is probably part of that
May 5, 2019, 8:55 PM
Zoe Hughes
I think repeating the entire song is more than just to be catchy, but that's just how I interpret it
May 5, 2019, 8:52 PM
Zoe Hughes
I haven't worked that but out
May 5, 2019, 8:52 PM
Zoe Hughes
That bits always confused me
May 5, 2019, 8:51 PM
George Hughes
Do you think the fact that she says Nope at the end of the choruses has anything to do with it as well?
May 5, 2019, 8:51 PM
George Hughes
Maybe so, although part of the repeating is because repetition makes for a catchy song
May 5, 2019, 8:50 PM
Zoe Hughes
So I've always interpreted that as it being a recurring chains of events
May 5, 2019, 8:45 PM
Zoe Hughes
Also it all repeats
May 5, 2019, 8:44 PM
George Hughes
Ohh yeah you're right, that line had me confused but that would make sense
May 5, 2019, 8:43 PM
Zoe Hughes
There's a line that 'byebye baby' or something like taht I think
May 5, 2019, 8:42 PM
George Hughes
Ah, I never got that, what part of the lyrics are about abortion?
May 5, 2019, 8:42 PM

I can set up a server now
May 5, 2019, 5:01 PM
Zoe Hughes
Sure
May 5, 2019, 5:01 PM
George Hughes
Want to go on a world our two selves?
May 5, 2019, 5:01 PM
George Hughes
I guess but it's their world and Callum says Katy prefers playing on her phone
May 5, 2019, 5:01 PM
Zoe Hughes
But she could use a laptop or computer to solve the problem right?
May 5, 2019, 4:58 PM
Zoe Hughes
Yea
May 5, 2019, 4:58 PM
George Hughes
Ohh I see, I think the problem is that Katy plays it on her phone
May 5, 2019, 4:58 PM
Zoe Hughes
Could Katy use callums account in the same way
May 5, 2019, 4:57 PM
Zoe Hughes
When I use your account for use both to play one a server
May 5, 2019, 4:57 PM
George Hughes
Describe what you were meaning again?
May 5, 2019, 4:56 PM
Zoe Hughes
I don't understand
May 5, 2019, 4:56 PM
George Hughes
Katy and Callum are both playing so I don't think that would work
May 5, 2019, 4:55 PM
Zoe Hughes
Could Katy use callums luke I do yours and we could all use a server taht way?
May 5, 2019, 4:55 PM
Zoe Hughes
Yeah
May 5, 2019, 4:54 PM
George Hughes
We can always go on a normal version server sometime, you don't need to buy anything for that if we're just playing together
May 5, 2019, 4:54 PM
Zoe Hughes
Yea
May 5, 2019, 4:53 PM
George Hughes
That would be cool, although I doubt they'll do that. Would require a large effort of cooperation between development teams and Minecraft isn't as popular as it used to be
May 5, 2019, 4:52 PM
Zoe Hughes
That would be a better approacg
May 5, 2019, 4:51 PM
Zoe Hughes
If they brought the pocket edition up to date a bit then they could just allow it to join a server on regular minecraft
May 5, 2019, 4:51 PM
George Hughes
Yeah it is, although I can understand why cause the pocket edition is quite behind
May 5, 2019, 4:50 PM
Zoe Hughes
Work
May 5, 2019, 4:50 PM
Zoe Hughes
It's a shame taht they couldn't make it woke for all versions
May 5, 2019, 4:49 PM
George Hughes
And the bedrock version kinda sucks
May 5, 2019, 4:49 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I can imagine, don't tell Callum but I'm not gonna get super into playing on his server haha
May 5, 2019, 4:49 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'd rather be able to play the proper version I think
May 5, 2019, 4:48 PM
George Hughes
So it's maybe not really worth it, but it's your call
May 5, 2019, 4:47 PM
Zoe Hughes
Oh
May 5, 2019, 4:47 PM
George Hughes
So you wouldn't be able to play the proper version
May 5, 2019, 4:47 PM
George Hughes
The bedrock thing
May 5, 2019, 4:47 PM
Zoe Hughes
Or this bedrock thing
May 5, 2019, 4:47 PM
George Hughes
It's the app
May 5, 2019, 4:47 PM
Zoe Hughes
Is it the account taht you pay for?
May 5, 2019, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
The server is in peaceful mode so I'm probsbly not going to get super into it, do you still want to get it?
May 5, 2019, 4:46 PM
Zoe Hughes
Will I need to get my card?
May 5, 2019, 4:45 PM
Zoe Hughes
Microsoft store is open
May 5, 2019, 4:45 PM

Good idea
May 3, 2019, 5:44 PM
George Hughes
Yeah good idea. I did read that quite a few people suggest not leaving kanji til last though, so to learn it along with the vocab
May 3, 2019, 5:44 PM
Zoe Hughes
Once I've refreshed what I learned before I can start to learn kanji and make use of them
May 3, 2019, 5:43 PM
George Hughes
Great, they're tricky though, they make you remember both separate readings for each kanji
May 3, 2019, 5:42 PM

That wouk d be useful
May 3, 2019, 5:41 PM

Would you want a copy of the digital flashcards I made when you start again?

You're right, although there's still a lot to learn from it
May 3, 2019, 5:37 PM

Megurine Luka was originally designed to be the first Vocaloid of the Character Vocal Series that Crypton Future Media would release and was going to be called "Hatsune Miku", designed to be capable of singing both English and Japanese vocals. However, the concept was put on hold and the name was used for another character, making Luka the 3rd vocal of the Character Vocal Series to be released instead.

Apr 17, 2019, 10:29 PM

Apr 17, 2019, 10:28 PM

Then because I've been through them like that I'll be able to use the site you sent and not get confused
Apr 17, 2019, 10:28 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'll make a table and update the hiragana table
Apr 17, 2019, 10:28 PM
George Hughes
Oh wait it only has notes for Kanji
Apr 17, 2019, 10:27 PM
George Hughes
But if you're worried, let me show you the other section
Apr 17, 2019, 10:26 PM
George Hughes
Trust me, I didn't
Apr 17, 2019, 10:26 PM
Zoe Hughes
Ye but that's trial and error an i might get confused
Apr 17, 2019, 10:26 PM
George Hughes
As far as I can tell, it has literally every character from the standard collection used by the Japanese
Apr 17, 2019, 10:26 PM
George Hughes
The one that I sent you
Apr 17, 2019, 10:25 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'm looking for a site to learn it with that I don't have to log in to
Apr 17, 2019, 10:25 PM
George Hughes
Probably by the end of the course, it will have covered all of them
Apr 17, 2019, 10:24 PM
George Hughes
True
Apr 17, 2019, 10:24 PM
Zoe Hughes
Yeah, buts it's still so ething we need to learn
Apr 17, 2019, 10:23 PM
George Hughes
Tbf katakana is kinda minimal, learning the characters is pretty quick, the tricky part for Japanese is the kanji and the grammar
Apr 17, 2019, 10:22 PM
George Hughes
Awh
Apr 17, 2019, 10:22 PM

When I was downloading it earlier I saw lingo deer is too big
Apr 17, 2019, 10:22 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I like duo too
Apr 17, 2019, 10:21 PM
Zoe Hughes
I like duo, and it's a smaller app so fits in my phone
Apr 17, 2019, 10:21 PM
George Hughes
Although they probably both have merits
Apr 17, 2019, 10:21 PM
George Hughes
Huh it might be more specialised than Duolingo then
Apr 17, 2019, 10:21 PM
Zoe Hughes
It's another language app, specifically Asian languages
Apr 17, 2019, 10:20 PM
Zoe Hughes
I wonder if taht has a section on katakana
Apr 17, 2019, 10:20 PM
George Hughes
Never heard of it
Apr 17, 2019, 10:20 PM
Zoe Hughes
There's an app called lingodeer
Apr 17, 2019, 10:20 PM
George Hughes
For its curriculum it's alright but personally I don't like things to be incomplete
Apr 17, 2019, 10:18 PM
Zoe Hughes
Interspersing them isn't taht helpful sometimes
Apr 17, 2019, 10:17 PM
George Hughes
It's given me maybe 15 characters at most
Apr 17, 2019, 10:17 PM
George Hughes
It does but I'm up to Time 2 and it's barely covered any of the alphabet
Apr 17, 2019, 10:16 PM
Zoe Hughes
Would be nice if duo had a katakana section
Apr 17, 2019, 10:16 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'll try that approach
Apr 17, 2019, 10:15 PM
George Hughes
After a few times going through it, you tend to be able to recognise them all and get most of them right
Apr 17, 2019, 10:15 PM
George Hughes
Mostly just by trial and error on that website
Apr 17, 2019, 10:14 PM
Zoe Hughes
How did you learn katakana?
Apr 17, 2019, 10:14 PM
George Hughes
The kanji flashcards on that website use a mix for the pronunciations
Apr 17, 2019, 10:12 PM
George Hughes
You should also practise the katakana as quite a lot of stuff online reads with a mix of hirigana and katakana
Apr 17, 2019, 10:11 PM
Zoe Hughes
Indeed
Apr 17, 2019, 10:10 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, although you'll need to do some every day for it to permanently stick :p
Apr 17, 2019, 10:10 PM

I've just learned the stuff this so it's quite fresh still, but I shows I absorbed it

Apr 17, 2019, 10:08 PM

Jan 25, 2019, 10:54 PM

I would argue that it's a birthday that's a part of us and the star signs just emerged from similarities in folk's behaviors
Jan 25, 2019, 10:53 PM

It's a part of us
Jan 25, 2019, 10:52 PM

Jan 25, 2019, 10:50 PM

To BBC, I have been watching Click on the publicly available platform of YouTube, please do not kick down my front door, the lock is quite expensive
Jan 17, 2019, 11:35 PM
Zoe Hughes
Careful, the BBC might be reading this and get suspicious
Jan 17, 2019, 11:34 PM
George Hughes
But that's good you're enjoying it, I haven't really been watching anything apart from Click recently
Jan 17, 2019, 11:33 PM
George Hughes
You want good drama, just take a trip to scone with me :p
Jan 17, 2019, 11:32 PM
Zoe Hughes
Aye, I don't think much of it nor mind it, it was just a shock. But it's a good drama
Jan 17, 2019, 11:31 PM
George Hughes
She probably didn't think anything of it, it's very normalised in tv, for better or worse
Jan 17, 2019, 11:30 PM
Zoe Hughes
No warning whatsoever, and mum didn't even tell me
Jan 17, 2019, 11:30 PM

I enjoy embracing new experiences so taking up student life in the city of Edinburgh is enticing. My natural curiosity has also led me to be an enthusiastic learner, which - combined with my practical, hands on approach to tasks - enables me to enjoy working with plants while understanding how they interact with each other and their surrounding environment. During a short spell of volunteering with local organisation Brig in Bloom I was able to explore this, as well as growing my creativity and confidence, through deciding the layout of a public flowerbed then planting it up and maintaining it by weeding.

Feb 27, 2018, 7:41 PM
Zoe Hughes
Leo- The Lion
Age-15
Leo was born into a very fortunate life. His family is very well off, old money runs in their family name but his father is a savvy business man who greatly increased their wealth. His mother is a highly attractive socialite and both parents take great pride in outward appearance of themselves and the family. Leo is an only child so is always the centre of attention. He is accustomed to a life of extreme luxury and admiration. At parties hosted by his parents he is always shown as his father's pride and joy with his father's brains and charisma and mothers bold features and smooth talking. This combination of attention and compliments grew his already huge natural ego. Due to this ego he seeks to be a star and a leader, often showing off and expecting everyone to admire him. He is loyal in relationships, friendly and romantic, however when a relationship ends he wouldn't take a second glance and would simply abandon it, never trying to save it but also never letting go of his grudge. Though his outward appearance is so bold and strong behind closed doors he is weak and clingy, fearful of the world outside parties and upper class pleasures. He isn't particularly close to anyone, company is about quantity not quality and closeness in his world.

Zoe Hughes
Ah yeah, he kinda does
May 22, 2017, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
Dean looks like he's painting with one hand and holding the torch with the other
May 22, 2017, 3:57 PM
Zoe Hughes
It's great for reflecting things in water and blending
May 22, 2017, 3:55 PM
George Hughes
Neat
May 22, 2017, 3:55 PM
Zoe Hughes
I'm actually planning on using watercolour
May 22, 2017, 3:55 PM

May 22, 2017, 3:52 PM
Zoe Hughes
And the directions are kinda how I positioned things
May 22, 2017, 3:50 PM
Zoe Hughes
That's just a rough sketch but where Dean shines the light there is a cityscape
May 22, 2017, 3:50 PM
Zoe Hughes
He is shining light on reality
May 22, 2017, 3:49 PM
Zoe Hughes
I decided Dean could just be a representation of a random person
May 22, 2017, 3:48 PM
Zoe Hughes
