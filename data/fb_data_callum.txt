Fair enough
Oct 27, 2019, 9:18 PM
George Hughes
A basic string of text gives a pretty reasonable result
Oct 27, 2019, 9:17 PM
George Hughes
I don't want to overcomplicate it, and emojis are kinda problematic with python
Oct 27, 2019, 9:17 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. Do you not get other stuff like time and reactions and stuff that are not needed for that?
Oct 27, 2019, 9:16 PM

Literally just highlight the whole comversation, ctrl c, ctrl v
Oct 27, 2019, 9:15 PM

So it has to read our conversation 200 times basically
Oct 27, 2019, 9:00 PM

An epoch is one run through the training data
Oct 27, 2019, 9:00 PM
George Hughes
At all times of day that is
Oct 27, 2019, 8:59 PM
George Hughes
Generally it's a good idea to keep recurrent neural networks away from water
Oct 27, 2019, 8:59 PM
Callum Davies
Two hundred epochs... Is that a lot? Is that good? What's an epoch? Are you not to get them wet or feed them after midnight?
Oct 27, 2019, 8:57 PM

verb shends, shending or shent (ʃɛnt) (tr) archaic. to put to shame. to chide or reproach. to injure or destroy.
Oct 27, 2019, 8:52 PM
Callum Davies
It's an actual word
Oct 27, 2019, 8:52 PM

Hahah is gravity the most selfish thing in the universe?
Oct 27, 2019, 11:06 AM
Callum Davies
Selfish gravity
Oct 27, 2019, 11:06 AM
Callum Davies
Gravity is a bully. Always pulling people down, needing to be in the centre
Oct 27, 2019, 11:05 AM
George Hughes
When you say affected by gravity, does it mean it said mean things and dragged you down into sadness?

While I don't have evidence to back up that claim, I think it makes sense to say
Oct 27, 2019, 11:02 AM
George Hughes
Even the greatest study ever conducted doesn't apply to everyone
Oct 27, 2019, 11:02 AM
Callum Davies
I don't know. But it seems like a well conducted study. They even had a placebo group to make sure it was the varying factor that was the varying factor lol
Oct 27, 2019, 11:01 AM
George Hughes
While it might have affected your memory, maybe suppressing your worries was essential so it made sense 💁🏼
Oct 27, 2019, 11:00 AM
George Hughes
Well that's just a general study, the effects won't be the same for everyone
Oct 27, 2019, 11:00 AM
Callum Davies
Ah well, I still passed the course 😅
Oct 27, 2019, 10:59 AM
Callum Davies
Haha, I often found myself worrying too much, so would pour myself a drink to stop me overthinking and try to get it done quicker. Seems that was the worst thing I could have done lol
Oct 27, 2019, 10:58 AM
George Hughes
No worries. I've been avoiding alcohol for the past six months but think I might start treating myself after revising😆
Oct 27, 2019, 10:57 AM

I might actually give it a read if I get the chance, cheers for showing me this

Oct 27, 2019, 10:55 AM
George Hughes
The graphs make it super clear
Oct 27, 2019, 10:55 AM
George Hughes
But it does improve recall if that negative stimuli lol
Oct 27, 2019, 10:54 AM
George Hughes
somewhat, it boosts neutral stimuli more
Oct 27, 2019, 10:54 AM
George Hughes
If you don't fancy reading it, essentially while alcohol impairs emotional memories that are made while you're under the influence, it improves memories made (especially neutral memory) when consumed afterwards.
Oct 27, 2019, 10:53 AM
Callum Davies
So "drowning your sorrows" doesn't work as if you've just had a major emotional stimuli, pouring yourself a drink is likely to help you to remember that feeling?

It certainly would, and it all adds to the collective. Isn't the while point of this that it doesn't matter if you can give £50,000 or 50p, anything makes a difference

That doesn't surprise me, they're basically buying Africa at this point
Oct 22, 2019, 2:12 PM

Not at all. I think in PPP, which is potential purchasing power, China is valued at something like $27 trillion, which is number one in the world
Oct 22, 2019, 2:12 PM
George Hughes
That's not the only variable to measure a country's success though
Oct 22, 2019, 2:11 PM
Callum Davies
It does still put it second in the world though
Oct 22, 2019, 2:10 PM
Callum Davies
Its nominal GDP is 14 trillion. So not that close haha
Oct 22, 2019, 2:10 PM
George Hughes
China is on its way past US I think
Oct 22, 2019, 2:08 PM
Callum Davies
Something like that, yeah. Point is, I think China and the US are pretty close to one another
Oct 22, 2019, 2:07 PM
George Hughes
Is China number one per capita or something?
Oct 22, 2019, 2:07 PM
Callum Davies
And depending on just how exactly you're measuring GDP, number 1 in the world is either the US or China
Oct 22, 2019, 2:06 PM
Callum Davies
I think North Korea's GDP is like 170th in the world or something
Oct 22, 2019, 2:05 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow there's magnitudes of difference
Oct 22, 2019, 2:05 PM
Callum Davies
The GDP of America is like $21.5 trillion I think
Oct 22, 2019, 2:04 PM
Callum Davies
I'd agree. Oh, so I looked this up a few mins ago, the GDP of North Korea is only $40bn. That's tiny compared to America

The US wouldn't do anything good with that information anyway
Oct 22, 2019, 2:01 PM
Callum Davies
That's true. So whilst it's true that China probably does have a lot of information about North Korea, they're not likely going to be sharing it with the US anytime soon
Oct 22, 2019, 2:00 PM
George Hughes
Well they're in a trade war at the moment
Oct 22, 2019, 1:59 PM
Callum Davies
Well, yes, but China are very much on North Korea's side. I know that if not an outright enemy, the US are certainly very wary about China right now
Oct 22, 2019, 1:59 PM
George Hughes
If anybody knows anything about Korea though, it'd be the Chinese
Oct 22, 2019, 1:57 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's true, it's an interesting war
Oct 22, 2019, 1:57 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that's possible. But Kim Jun Un is very good at keeping his circles close knit, as well as keeping North Korea a closed climate, information and immigration wise. I'm not saying it's impossible, but it would certainly be very difficult to get a spy into North Korea. Let alone into a position of power to gather the necessary intelligence
Oct 22, 2019, 1:56 PM
George Hughes
It's possible that there're spies within North Korea but the information is classified so we can't know about their findings
Oct 22, 2019, 1:54 PM
Callum Davies
Well, you'd think so. But they claim to have massive underground nuclear testing facilities, which wouldn't be able to be picked up with a drone, which is the only form of surveillance we have on North Korea at the moment.
Oct 22, 2019, 1:52 PM
George Hughes
Or a potential nuclear test
Oct 22, 2019, 1:51 PM
George Hughes
But surely we could detect a nuclear test?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:51 PM
George Hughes
I suppose yeah
Oct 22, 2019, 1:51 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that's the thing, isn't it? They claim they do, but they're so secretive that there's no way of actually knowing if those claims are true or not
Oct 22, 2019, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
I thought their weapons weren't properly tested
Oct 22, 2019, 1:49 PM
George Hughes
So the N Koreans actually pose a nuclear threat?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:49 PM
Callum Davies
It's the exact same tensions and promise of mutually assured destruction as with the US and Russia
Oct 22, 2019, 1:47 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, we essentially are. The US are in a cold war with North Korea in all but name at the moment
Oct 22, 2019, 1:47 PM
George Hughes
I don't really understand the scale though
Oct 22, 2019, 1:46 PM
George Hughes
We're basically in the middle of a cold war by that logic
Oct 22, 2019, 1:46 PM
Callum Davies
The largest gap between midnight was seventeen, which was in 1991. The year the cold war ended. So it started with the cold war, its closest was at the height of the cold war in 53 with 2 minutes, when the cold war ended the clock was set to the largest gap its ever had. And now we're right back to two again

But 2 minutes is still more than 30 seconds, which is more than 1 second
Oct 22, 2019, 1:43 PM
Callum Davies
And god, I hope not. Apparently the two factors considered for the doomsday clock is global warming and the likelihood of nuclear annihilation. When it hits midnight is literally the point it's been announced that Russia has just fired off 100 nukes or something like that. Midnight is certain imminent death
Oct 22, 2019, 1:43 PM
George Hughes
Ahhh I see
Oct 22, 2019, 1:41 PM
Callum Davies
Oh wow, apparently Stalin died in 1953, which I think led to the us and Russia having a nuclear arms race, and basically fighting over who had the most nukes. So no wonder it shifted to two minutes in 1953
Oct 22, 2019, 1:41 PM
George Hughes
Think it'll keep edging closer to midnight?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:39 PM
Callum Davies
The doomsday clock was most likely set up as a way of monitoring the cold war
👍George Hughes
Oct 22, 2019, 1:39 PM
George Hughes
Ahh okay, I never realised it was so close on the tail
Oct 22, 2019, 1:39 PM
Callum Davies
Started in 1947, so that can't be a coincidence
Oct 22, 2019, 1:38 PM
George Hughes
Take a look, you're more likely to be right
Oct 22, 2019, 1:38 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, was I too early? I thought the cold war was pretty much immediately after the second world war, and so I wasn't sure if 1953 was too late. But it would make sense. I'll look up some key years
Oct 22, 2019, 1:38 PM
George Hughes
Cold war would be a tad later maybe? I'm no historian though
Oct 22, 2019, 1:37 PM
Callum Davies
To my knowledge, it's never been closer than 2 minutes before. As I say, I believe the only other time since it was set up in 1947 it's been that close was in 1953, which would have been the cold war, right? Dunno if my dates are a little out
Oct 22, 2019, 1:36 PM
George Hughes
I dunno if I should laugh or not
Oct 22, 2019, 1:35 PM
Callum Davies
It's literally shifted from three to two minutes during trump's presidency 😅
Oct 22, 2019, 1:34 PM
George Hughes
Bloody hell that's a huge shift
Oct 22, 2019, 1:34 PM
Callum Davies
Scary stuff man
Oct 22, 2019, 1:33 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, and the idea is that it's symbolic, in which midnight is the Armageddon point. But like, in 1998 it was at 9 minutes. Within our lives, it's shifted that far
Oct 22, 2019, 1:33 PM
George Hughes
Ah good it's run by scientists
Oct 22, 2019, 1:31 PM
Callum Davies
Science and Security Board
Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists
Oct 22, 2019, 1:31 PM
George Hughes
Interesting idea, good for raising awareness
Oct 22, 2019, 1:31 PM
George Hughes
Ahhh okay so it's a general doomsday clock
Oct 22, 2019, 1:31 PM
Callum Davies
It was 2 and a half minutes in 2017, and the statement was given "In 2017, the Bulletin moved the time of the Doomsday Clock a half-minute closer to midnight, in part because of reckless approaches toward nuclear weapons and a growing disregard for the expertise needed to address today’s biggest challenges, most importantly climate change"
Oct 22, 2019, 1:30 PM
George Hughes
Deciding when to move them that is
Oct 22, 2019, 1:30 PM
George Hughes
Ahh okay, who is in charge of moving the hands?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:29 PM
Callum Davies
You can look at the timeline online. And there's always a press statement released alongside any shift detailing the reasons why. Ginmie a sec, I'll take a look
Oct 22, 2019, 1:28 PM
George Hughes
Why did it change last year and what was it before that?
Oct 22, 2019, 1:26 PM
Callum Davies
So this is quite a scary thought. Did you know that, as of right now, the doomsday clock is at 2 minutes to midnight. It moved there last year, the first time since 1953. We are literally on the brink of nuclear war
Oct 22, 2019, 1:15 PM
George Hughes
I would expect nothing less 😆

Should do, still not received any notifications though 💁🏼
Oct 14, 2019, 6:29 PM

Oh, I'm sure it's nothing. It'll work again, I'm sure.
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:29 PM
George Hughes
Kinda annoyed that mc wasn't working, that was good fun to do
Oct 14, 2019, 6:29 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, okay then 🙂
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:25 PM
George Hughes
Probs best, I find myself getting anxious that things aren't getting done if I sit for too long
Oct 14, 2019, 6:24 PM
Callum Davies
YouTube it is then haha
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:20 PM
George Hughes
I like my entertainment to appeal to my short attention span
Oct 14, 2019, 6:18 PM
George Hughes
Don't have the patience lol
Oct 14, 2019, 6:18 PM
George Hughes
I haven't watched a film in ages
Oct 14, 2019, 6:18 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's true
Oct 14, 2019, 6:18 PM
Callum Davies
We shall have to see. Won't be so bad for YouTube, though. Might be more important for it to be good quality if we were watching a film though
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:18 PM
George Hughes
Might look kinda grainy on my side
Oct 14, 2019, 6:17 PM
George Hughes
All depends if my bandwidth is up for the task really
Oct 14, 2019, 6:17 PM
George Hughes
That sounds fun too
Oct 14, 2019, 6:16 PM
Callum Davies
It's not limited to 2 people, either. You can have lobbies, so even you me and Zoe could do a group call if we were all free haha
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:16 PM
George Hughes
It can't be any worse than the delay that it takes for someone to speak
Oct 14, 2019, 6:16 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, almost certainly. If it can work with Netflix, I see no reason why it wouldn't with Amazon prime. There may be a slight delay issue, as whoever was hosting would be streaming said video to the other person, but it shouldn't be too bad, I hope
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:15 PM
George Hughes
It could probably work with amazon prime
Oct 14, 2019, 6:14 PM
George Hughes
Well yeah that sounds like a great idea, we could stick on some YouTube together sometime then
Oct 14, 2019, 6:14 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine, it's not about the game really, is it? It's just any excuse to hang out. On that point, as I say, there is a way I've found to just chat and watch YouTube if we want. It's called Kast, there is a browser option for Chrome, or a desktop program if you're so inclined. It does mean signing up for a new account on something, but it means we can watch YouTube, Netflix, anything we like together whilst just video calling and chatting at the same time. It's a video party/ movie night type programme. If it can read a video player, we may even be able to watch DVDs together haha
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:13 PM
George Hughes
I don't even know the controls
Oct 14, 2019, 6:10 PM
George Hughes
I'll be rubbish without the controller though let me warn you
Oct 14, 2019, 6:10 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, we'll play some rocket league soon then 🙂
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:09 PM
George Hughes
Aye I'm keen to join
Oct 14, 2019, 6:08 PM
George Hughes
It's a big game
Oct 14, 2019, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies
It's taking ages to download anyway
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies
No probs, just wondering. No pressure lol
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 6:07 PM
George Hughes
I'll need to do some work tonight but can probably find some time one evening to play
Oct 14, 2019, 6:06 PM
George Hughes
Sorry been out in town with Zoë all afternoon
Oct 14, 2019, 6:06 PM
Callum Davies
I've also discovered a way that we can watch YouTube together, if we want to. I'll talk you through it over a call if you want to
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 5:28 PM
Callum Davies
So I bought rocket league hehe
😮George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 5:25 PM
Callum Davies
If I buy rocket league, wanna play together tonight? It's just the half price offer on it at the moment is only available until 6:00 tonight haha

George Hughes
Here's one, strip jenga
Oct 14, 2019, 1:32 PM
Callum Davies
Except it's putting stuff on instead of taking it away
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 1:30 PM
Callum Davies
Or Jenga
😠George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 1:29 PM

Okay I get it 😂
Oct 14, 2019, 1:29 PM
George Hughes
Ahh I see
Oct 14, 2019, 1:29 PM
Callum Davies
You know, the game with the little donkey, and you have to take turns putting stuff on its back, and it'll randomly kick up and throw all the stuff off, and the person who puts the item on that causes it to do that loses
Oct 14, 2019, 1:28 PM
George Hughes
Ngl I don't actually know how buckaroo works
Oct 14, 2019, 1:27 PM
Callum Davies
We may have played a little game of human buckaroo
Oct 14, 2019, 1:27 PM

How do you just sleep through that 😂😂

That's nothing, Catherine was once round Abernethy, she fell asleep, and I'll find the picture just now...
Oct 14, 2019, 1:26 PM
George Hughes
Clean laundry I hope
Oct 14, 2019, 1:24 PM
George Hughes
Now the challenge is how much laundry can you gather there before she moves
Oct 14, 2019, 1:24 PM
Callum Davies
Katy is so static that I can stack my clothes on her
Oct 14, 2019, 1:17 PM
Callum Davies

😆George Hughes
Oct 14, 2019, 1:16 PM
George Hughes
Aye aye I can indeed
Oct 14, 2019, 1:10 PM
Callum Davies
I think you can still view it with needing an account. I too, do not have the Twitter
Oct 14, 2019, 12:59 PM
George Hughes
Nah I'll check him out, although I don't have the twitter
Oct 14, 2019, 12:55 PM
George Hughes
I'll generate my own absurd movie scripts thank you very much
Oct 14, 2019, 12:54 PM
Callum Davies
He's done loads of them it seems. You should take a look at that guy's main Twitter page
Oct 14, 2019, 12:53 PM

I haven't seen the movies but I can imagine what they're like just by reading this

Awesome, no rush 🙂
👍George Hughes
Oct 13, 2019, 5:49 PM

But after that, I'll be free
Oct 13, 2019, 5:49 PM
George Hughes
Then I'll need to have dinner
Oct 13, 2019, 5:49 PM
George Hughes
I'm about to go out and grab some stuff from the shop
Oct 13, 2019, 5:49 PM
Callum Davies
Hiya, that's me back from dropping Katy off. I still have to fix myself something to eat and sort out some washing, but I should still have time to play before I need to head again
Oct 13, 2019, 5:48 PM
Callum Davies
The Karoom called you.
Oct 13, 2019, 3:59 PM
George Hughes
Sure thing
Oct 13, 2019, 3:55 PM
Callum Davies
Wanna do a call on here just now, while we get it set up?
Oct 13, 2019, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, I think it's taking me through a tutorial just now
Oct 13, 2019, 3:53 PM
George Hughes
I changed a setting and it froze
Oct 13, 2019, 3:53 PM
George Hughes
Great
Oct 13, 2019, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
The restart seemed to work
Oct 13, 2019, 3:52 PM
Callum Davies
I'm just booting it up now
Oct 13, 2019, 3:51 PM
George Hughes
Looks like I'm in
Oct 13, 2019, 3:50 PM
Callum Davies
I'm excited to try it
Oct 13, 2019, 3:49 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, I wanna try this
Oct 13, 2019, 3:49 PM
George Hughes
If it's gonna be hassle, we could just play miencraft
Oct 13, 2019, 3:49 PM
Callum Davies
I'll quickly try restarting my computer, see if that does anything
Oct 13, 2019, 3:49 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, so for whatever reason, the connect through steam function isn't working, so I'll just quickly create a VRChat account
Oct 13, 2019, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
It's reasonably priced when it comes to smartphones, but the games available for that just aren't very good
Oct 13, 2019, 3:48 PM
Callum Davies
Just a sec, I think there's an external server portal or something it's asking to download. Something about me needing it to connect to worlds
Oct 13, 2019, 3:47 PM
Callum Davies
I'm waiting for the price of vr to come down, as is generally the case with most technology. But it just doesn't seem to be happening with VR for whatever reason! 😡
Oct 13, 2019, 3:44 PM
George Hughes
Poor man's mode
Oct 13, 2019, 3:44 PM
Callum Davies

😆George Hughes
Oct 13, 2019, 3:43 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, it's asking me which mode I want it in
Oct 13, 2019, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
We'll see once it's up and running
Oct 13, 2019, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
Yeah it might be a hassle
Oct 13, 2019, 3:43 PM
Callum Davies
We'll see how good the in game voice chat is first
Oct 13, 2019, 3:42 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, okay then. How we gonna do voice chat? Because the in game chat will inevitably be a piece of shit, but we'll see. I'm just thinking if we have a call between us on discord but are also talking to people in the game, it could get very confusing. Also, unless we mute each other in the game, we'll get 2 sources of talking to each other, which would be very confusing
Oct 13, 2019, 3:41 PM
George Hughes
Now it says ten
Oct 13, 2019, 3:39 PM
George Hughes
Apparently it's gonna take 25 minutes 🙄
Oct 13, 2019, 3:39 PM
George Hughes
Installing it now
Oct 13, 2019, 3:38 PM
George Hughes
Wait I don't have it on steam
Oct 13, 2019, 3:37 PM
Callum Davies
Steam's telling me about 5 mins left for me to download it
Oct 13, 2019, 3:37 PM
Callum Davies
The download shouldn't take too long for me
Oct 13, 2019, 3:35 PM
George Hughes
It should already be installed on mine but I'll check
Oct 13, 2019, 3:34 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, I'm having to install it anyway
Oct 13, 2019, 3:33 PM
George Hughes
Gimme ten minutes then let's do it
Oct 13, 2019, 3:33 PM
Callum Davies
Aww, go on, let's go on vr chat together
Oct 13, 2019, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
Probably worse with the headset
Oct 13, 2019, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
Though
Oct 13, 2019, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
Thougj
Oct 13, 2019, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
It's awful tough
Oct 13, 2019, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
Yeah you can just play it like a normal game
Oct 13, 2019, 3:32 PM
Callum Davies
You know what, that doesn't matter. VR chat can be played without necessarily needing a vr headset, right?
Oct 13, 2019, 3:29 PM
George Hughes
The real question is why do you not?
Oct 13, 2019, 3:28 PM
George Hughes
Um good question
Oct 13, 2019, 3:28 PM
George Hughes
That sounds fun, I don't have a controller here though so I wouldn't be very good at it
Oct 13, 2019, 3:28 PM
Callum Davies
So I was just on steam, because rocket league is half price at the moment and I was considering buying it so we could play together. Why do you own vr chat?
Oct 13, 2019, 3:27 PM
Callum Davies
I don't need to imagine



I've learned not to do that again the hard way
😮George Hughes
Oct 13, 2019, 3:23 PM
George Hughes
Imagine just walking into a classroom and saying umm master pervert, um UwU
Oct 13, 2019, 3:21 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, almost certainly
😆George Hughes
Oct 13, 2019, 3:18 PM
George Hughes
Also I'm pretty sure they kick you out if you went in and said that 😂😂
Oct 13, 2019, 3:17 PM
George Hughes
I appreciate the pause between hentai-senpai chan and UwU
Oct 13, 2019, 3:16 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, you speak far better Japanese than I. If it were me there, I just be like "Erm, yes. Un, hentai-senpai...chan. ...




UwU"
Oct 13, 2019, 3:15 PM
George Hughes
On Friday night I went to a Japanese speaking night, I was pretty nervous but it was good fun once I was there
Oct 13, 2019, 3:12 PM
Callum Davies
Thank you. So what's been going on in your weekend then?
Oct 13, 2019, 3:10 PM
George Hughes
That's how it should be, great to hear it! 😁
Oct 13, 2019, 3:08 PM
Callum Davies
It went well, it wasn't all business either. Sometimes the chat was just nice and casual, I feel I ingratiated myself rather well to them
Oct 13, 2019, 3:03 PM
George Hughes
How did the meeting go?
Oct 13, 2019, 2:53 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow that's a trek
Oct 13, 2019, 2:52 PM
Callum Davies
I don't know what you could mean, George 😅 not much, was in bloody Berwick yesterday for a job in December. Was just meeting him halfway, which for us was Berwick haja
Oct 13, 2019, 2:52 PM
George Hughes
Whatchu been up to this weekend anyways?
Oct 13, 2019, 2:48 PM
George Hughes
I was thinking our collective experiences in that field 😆
Oct 13, 2019, 2:47 PM
Callum Davies
I wasn't refering to my personal experiences, specifically! 😆 Was just riffing on how relationships mature as we do as people
Oct 13, 2019, 2:47 PM
George Hughes
Oh god I don't want to think about that 😆
Oct 13, 2019, 2:46 PM
Callum Davies
Aah, the S3 relationship that's "the one, mum, I swear!"
😢George Hughes
Oct 13, 2019, 2:45 PM

Maybe not as adults hahah
Oct 13, 2019, 2:43 PM
Callum Davies
I very much doubt, but as I say, not to that extreme
Oct 13, 2019, 2:42 PM
George Hughes
I actually don't doubt that there's people like that 😂
Oct 13, 2019, 2:39 PM
Callum Davies
An exaggeration, I'll admit, but you get my point
Oct 13, 2019, 2:38 PM
Callum Davies
Exactly. But you can get people who are like "She likes all the same films as me, I find her really attractive, I can really imagine a future with her, she's really easy to talk to, the conversation just flows between us, but she likes nu-age metal and not symphonic metal, so I'm gonna have to cut it off"
😆George Hughes
Oct 13, 2019, 2:38 PM
George Hughes
I think I understand, most of my friends I only have a couple things in common with but that's what makes it interesting
Oct 13, 2019, 2:34 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, thank you. And I will remind you of one thing that I have learned, but I'm sure you already know. A lot of people think that differences, no matter how small, mean that it can't work. I'd disagree, because obviously massive differences could be a problem, but Katy's different to me in, say, music tastes, and she's actually introduced me to bands I've otherwise pigeon holed and not given a chance, like panic at the disco haha
Oct 13, 2019, 2:32 PM
George Hughes
Well I shall provide you with your dose of ego boost too by reminding you that Katy is lucky to have captured you all to herself 💁🏼
Oct 13, 2019, 2:29 PM
Callum Davies
Nothing wrong with a nice little ego boost now and then
Oct 13, 2019, 2:28 PM
George Hughes
You do indeed flatter me ♥️
Oct 13, 2019, 2:27 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, well I'm glad to hear that! Although, not surprised she asked you out, you're quite the catch! 😉 I don't blame her for wanting to bag you all for herself hehe. But it sounds like things went well.
Oct 13, 2019, 2:26 PM

Oct 13, 2019, 2:21 PM

Still really impressive though!
Oct 13, 2019, 2:19 PM
George Hughes
Aye his timing was a bit off too
Oct 13, 2019, 2:19 PM
Callum Davies
I could see him struggling a little bit with the last level though. There were some twitches in his face that looked like he was having a hard time keeping up
Oct 13, 2019, 2:18 PM
George Hughes
Some tasty chords
Oct 13, 2019, 2:17 PM
George Hughes
Definitely, I really liked the second last level
Oct 13, 2019, 2:17 PM
Callum Davies
I just thought it was quite interesting. Yeah, it's a meme, but he seems to be applying relatively advanced music theory to it. He seems to know what he's doing

Probsbly not if you want to have any time left
Is it a bit like one piece?
Or bleach
The anime that is, not the fluid
That's over quite quickly, so I hear
Yeah, I tried it once and I felt sick within the length of less than an episode
Ooh no
Is it hard to watch then?
I was talking about the fluid
I really must sleep now
Purposely shit or just shit? Can't tell
Then sleep, I have I have elevated your spirits with memes, now achieve a state of unconsciousness with relative ease

So an old work colleague has posted this...
Oct 6, 2019, 8:53 PM
George Hughes
Well considering I've got three months worth of our conversation (120,000 characters) and after about 40 minutes of learning on just 1000 characters, it still talks complete nonsense, I think our conversations will suffice
Oct 6, 2019, 8:53 PM
Callum Davies
Are you teaching it using any more conversations, or just ours?
Oct 6, 2019, 8:50 PM
Callum Davies
This will be glorious
Oct 6, 2019, 8:50 PM

And first sentence
Oct 6, 2019, 8:50 PM

Please let me know it's first word
Oct 6, 2019, 8:50 PM

I'm looking forward to its first word being "hentai"
Oct 6, 2019, 8:45 PM

And compressing the input characters
Oct 6, 2019, 8:44 PM
George Hughes
Maybe batch learning on multi cores or some shit
Oct 6, 2019, 8:43 PM
George Hughes
Probably not even, it would need a more engineered solution
Oct 6, 2019, 8:43 PM

I'm assuming the only way to speed up the process would be oodles more ram up the jacksie?
Oct 6, 2019, 8:42 PM

I might need to make a few revisions, right now, there's lots and lots of data and it learns very slowly

Yeah, just the first one. There was very little plot, not gonna lie, but the character is very human, and it's very enjoyable. I can see why it enjoys such a good reputation

Yes. If you don't have rip on your grave, you get to join the skeleton army
Oct 2, 2019, 12:29 PM

Is it a conscription then?
Oct 2, 2019, 12:29 PM

Just make sure you don't have "R.I.P" on your grave. That way, you too can join the skeleton army
Oct 2, 2019, 12:28 PM

My preferred method would be using verbose language in a monotonous format, describing my utter pleasure toward the situation.
Sep 28, 2019, 9:59 PM

What function would you use to express said happiness
Sep 28, 2019, 9:58 PM

Well, you know what they say; there's no pleasing a crack whore
Sep 28, 2019, 9:04 PM

Surely if I want to be a whore, I don't want them to respect me so much
Sep 28, 2019, 9:04 PM

You need to work harder if you want the respect of your whore counterparts
Sep 28, 2019, 9:03 PM

Wow that hurts, I can't believe my whore peers thought that way about me
Sep 28, 2019, 9:02 PM

You're a joke of a whore. You'll surely be shunned by the rest of the whore community
😆George Hughes
Sep 28, 2019, 8:58 PM

So does that mean I'm a whore for jokes or I'm just joking about being a whore

Sep 28, 2019, 8:24 PM

A very cheap one, yes. Would probably sound awful. Literally like £10. It's just a prop. The morph suit is like £25! Not gonna lie, more expensive than I expected

Basically, you get lots of karma per upvote to begin with, but then as it grows, less karma is given out per upvote

Oh, I'm not denying that. I'm just talking about me personally. I could write a very long essay on the subject, but that would take up a lot of space on your screen 😅

I don't believe anyone is more knowledgeable or qualified to discuss privacy than the able Internet users of our generation
Sep 11, 2019, 11:44 AM
Callum Davies
We can dream, but I think that carries with it it's own problems. Plus, people would always make themselves private if they want to. You'd just find a market of (what would then be) illegal encryption software pop into existence. I think you should be allowed private information. It's a very complex issue that people far more eloquent than I have written about far more concisely
Sep 11, 2019, 11:42 AM
George Hughes
Do you think a world without privacy could and will exist?
Sep 11, 2019, 11:39 AM
George Hughes
Absolutely
Sep 11, 2019, 11:38 AM
Callum Davies
Oh yeah, I get that. That's what I'm saying, kind of. In that the NSA documents needed to be made public, but that they couldn't have been had Edward Snowden not been able to share them without anybody knowing that it was him. Because he was working for the NSA at the time, and he may have disappeared 😕
Sep 11, 2019, 11:36 AM
George Hughes
I'm partially of the opinion that there should be no anonymity whatsoever and that all information should be available to everyone. But I'm sure that would cause its own problems
Sep 11, 2019, 11:35 AM
Callum Davies
I personally think it's a good thing. Because if it weren't for that sort of thing, information that should be made public couldn't be. Some information needs to be shared anonymously. It's like the Edward Snowden thing, if it weren't for the anonymity, we still wouldn't know today what the NSA were doing, which was a breach of our privacy
Sep 11, 2019, 11:33 AM
George Hughes
Good way to transfer information quietly

Sep 11, 2019, 11:31 AM
Callum Davies
It's not all drug deals, you know. Many legitimate news organisations use deep web dropboxes to receive anonymous tip offs. Okay, not actually Dropbox itself, but the deep web equivalent of it. It's actually a really good way of keeping information free. Because sometimes there is information that needs to be made public, but the person can't release it without being known. It's actually how Edward snowden revealed the NSA documents

I don't know anything about onion addresses, who me? I wouldn't do such a thing
Sep 11, 2019, 11:27 AM
Callum Davies
I think it's to stop you from accidentally stumbling onto a .onion address. It's very unlikely you'll find a . onion address unless you're given it. It's to keep it secret
Sep 11, 2019, 11:26 AM
George Hughes
Hey technically tumblr is a random alphanumeric string. If you ran it through a determinate finite automata for random alphanumeric strings, it would pass
Sep 11, 2019, 11:25 AM
Callum Davies
Anyway, this is very inaccurate. .onion addresses are always random alphanumeric strings, aren't they? So a . onion address is more like lZs5s673Fzg.onion

Hi George, bit of a weird question, but where did you get your tiny watering can that you use to water your cacti from? We're looking to get one for our cacti 😅
Sep 4, 2019, 4:15 PM

I am honoured. The pleasure was truly all mine, and you weren't in my hair even a single bit. Hope you're back in Perth, happy to be home and enjoying the company of Katy after long time away.
As for me, just finished my last of work, sad to be leaving. But excited for Paris et l'université ! Je crois que ce serais une bonne année !
Aug 29, 2019, 5:57 PM
Callum Davies
But honestly, I can't thank you enough for giving me a place to stay. I know it was a big ask pretty much out of nowhere. It's been such a pleasure staying with you, and the amazing time I've had working for the underbelly would not have been possible without you. You, good sir, are a gentleman and a scholar. Which is the highest compliment I believe I am capable of giving someone! 😁
Aug 29, 2019, 11:29 AM
Callum Davies
That is me gone! I'm out your hair, finally! You have your own house back now haha. I've locked the back door behind me, dropped the key through the letterbox of the front door. Am now at the station waiting for the train......which is delayed and the expected time keeps getting farther away from now on the live departure board thing. So that's fun 👍🏻

You weren't up when I left so pretend this is a note you found on the landing :P
I've got one thing to say to you: there's some potatoes in the kitchen next to the pizza boxes. Please take them because I won't have time to use them so they're going to go off

Aug 20, 2019, 8:29 PM

And jealous and of him being married? Again, not really, in a good way. Not really comparable. He's been with marzia for 8 years now, was 7 when he proposed, and god knows he has the money for a wedding. Plus he's almost 30, I'm barely 21. I've been dating Katy for 18 months. I don't have the money for a wedding at the moment
Aug 20, 2019, 8:27 PM
George Hughes
Lol as he's proved multiple times
Aug 20, 2019, 8:24 PM
Callum Davies
Of PewDiePie? With the best will in the world, not really. He's very likeable, and I can tell he loves what he does, but that lifestyle wouldn't be for me. And money doesn't necessarily mean happiness. More often than not it creates more problems than it solves
Aug 20, 2019, 8:24 PM

That's not a political statement in any way, just a shower thought on our usages of the word "intolerant'

Sometimes I get a slight discomfort from drinking milk, but I'm not lactose intolerant.
Aug 19, 2019, 6:05 PM
Callum Davies
Also, side note: lactose is one of the only intolerances that people are okay with you having.
Aug 19, 2019, 6:04 PM
Callum Davies
May I ask the reason for your going lacto free?
Aug 19, 2019, 6:04 PM
George Hughes
I used to love drinking milk back when I wasn't drinking lacto free
Aug 19, 2019, 6:03 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. I'm kinda craving a glass of milk anyway, so it'll get finished soon one way or another haha
Aug 19, 2019, 6:01 PM

I think it'd last another two bowls
Aug 19, 2019, 6:01 PM

Aug 19, 2019, 5:51 PM

Yeah, it's confusing. Co-op food is a business name, but a food co-operative is also the name given to a business structure. It's confusing.
Aug 19, 2019, 5:51 PM
George Hughes
And it's not technical untrue
Aug 19, 2019, 5:48 PM
George Hughes
Anything that's a part of the co-operative I refer to as a co-op because its easier to say
Aug 19, 2019, 5:48 PM
Callum Davies
So I may have misunderstood
Aug 19, 2019, 5:47 PM
Callum Davies
It is *A* co-operative, but it is not part of the company known as co-op. According to a very quick Google search.
Aug 19, 2019, 5:47 PM
George Hughes
Scotmid are part of the coop chain or something
Aug 19, 2019, 5:46 PM
Callum Davies
You call it co-op, but the big sign says scotmid. Does the one own the other or something? I'm am confusion
Aug 19, 2019, 5:45 PM

If you were working for a letting agency, then you would probably have to worry about that

Aug 17, 2019, 8:45 PM

Although, it's a fine line. I need to make it clear that it's just for business when I'm asking my female colleagues for their number. And I've not hidden the fact I have a girlfriend from other staff in conversation, and people talk. Don't want to end up getting an unfair reputation as a sleaze haha
Aug 17, 2019, 8:44 PM

It was even like, they were already giving me daggers, and were sitting at the back right next to the sound desk, so I felt really scared to radio FOH for backup, as it were. We don't have any sort of silent alarm in place yet. We have a technician's group chat on WhatsApp, but can't use that to contact FOH. technicians only. Definitely gonna get the numbers of FOH staff after tonight

What kind of show was it?
Aug 17, 2019, 7:36 PM

It's easy if it's a play. A comedian, hecklers are almost encouraged, so the line for being distrubtive is more blurred in that scenario

Yeah 😑

Because it was going to be 2020, because the last scheduled election was in 2015. But then may called the snap election in 2017, so that pushed it back to 2022, due to the fixed term parliament act
Aug 17, 2019, 6:02 PM

I don't think that will happen again, because the last one didn't solve anything

He's a famous serial adulterer. He's now separated with his wife, and most recently his neighbours had heard him having raised voices with his current live-in girlfriend.

Is 11:30 okay for me to get the train on the 29th? Or would you like me out sooner?

Aug 12, 2019, 9:17 PM
George Hughes
Glad I could have you
Aug 12, 2019, 9:16 PM
George Hughes
I'm sure you would have found somewhere, but it's great to be able to flatshare with you! :D Always thought it would be fun to do that
Aug 12, 2019, 9:15 PM
Callum Davies
And obviously, thank you so much for all your hospitality, I honestly couldn't have had this amazing experience if it weren't for you
Aug 12, 2019, 9:15 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine, that was my plan anyway. I just don't want to be heading home on the 28th because I'll be so shattered haha
Aug 12, 2019, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
;)
Aug 12, 2019, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
If you needed to stay longer, can always lock the back door and post the key through the letterbox on your way out
Aug 12, 2019, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
So if that works for you, then cool
Aug 12, 2019, 9:13 PM
George Hughes
I don't want to kick you out but there's probably not much reason for you to be there after then
Aug 12, 2019, 9:13 PM
Callum Davies
Hi there, so you're leaving on the 30th, right? The job ends on the late evening/ early morning of the 28th/29th. So I'll book my train ticket back home for the morning of the 29th, about 10 or 11am I reckon, and then I'll be out your hair for the 30th. The dates and times seemed to have aligned quite well
Aug 12, 2019, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
Enjoy your dinner!
Aug 12, 2019, 7:13 PM
Callum Davies
Thank you very much, I'm having dinner with Katy ATM, but I'll message you on the train, or talk to you tomorrow. I'm getting on a out 10pm tonight
Aug 12, 2019, 7:12 PM

Oh, also, how bad would it be for me to have a shower once I got in tonight? Or will I just wait until the morning?
Aug 8, 2019, 5:47 PM
Callum Davies
Nope haha. I got up late, so I didn't have time for breakfast. And my buses were back to back, so I couldn't nip into a shop during a stopover. As are the shows, so I don't know when I'm getting food lol
Aug 8, 2019, 5:46 PM

Have you had much to eat today?

No, not that. I'm tired, hungry, and my girlfriend's currently in the hospital. So yeah, I'm not in the greatest mood at the moment, but that's neither or your fault, so I'm sorry
Aug 8, 2019, 5:43 PM

No I understand it's frustrating, but it's just an unfortunate clash that comes from living with other people
Aug 8, 2019, 5:42 PM

Aug 8, 2019, 5:40 PM

Aug 6, 2019, 4:55 PM
George Hughes
Oh no, can you get time off to visit her?
Aug 6, 2019, 4:55 PM

Yeah, she's back at the hospital. We'll see when she gets out
Aug 6, 2019, 4:54 PM

Aug 6, 2019, 4:54 PM

Okay then. Katy may not be coming after all
Aug 6, 2019, 4:52 PM

If you have any left after that, go on then :p
Aug 6, 2019, 4:52 PM
George Hughes
Might Katy want one or two for when she comes?
Aug 6, 2019, 4:52 PM
Callum Davies
Want some free day tickets? I'm gonna get a month pass whilst in town tomorrow (much cheaper in the long run) and got a few tickets left over. I think you can share unused tickets in the m'tickets app

Aug 1, 2019, 8:58 PM
George Hughes
Is it comfortable enough on the buses?
Aug 1, 2019, 8:56 PM
George Hughes
Oh aye!
Aug 1, 2019, 8:56 PM
Callum Davies
I won't look out for it, I'll probably have my eyes closed 🤣
😆George Hughes
Aug 1, 2019, 8:56 PM
George Hughes
You'll pass that on the bus
Aug 1, 2019, 8:55 PM
George Hughes
I'm not keen on central cause I don't like busy places, but maybe somewhere like Gorgie
Aug 1, 2019, 8:55 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I'm joking, of course. You gonna try to find somewhere more central do you think?
Aug 1, 2019, 8:54 PM
George Hughes
Life is like that
Aug 1, 2019, 8:54 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha no I don't hold anything against him, he made his choice
Aug 1, 2019, 8:54 PM
George Hughes
I'll find somewhere like this again once I'm a working man if I miss it
Aug 1, 2019, 8:53 PM
Callum Davies
Well, it would be a nice change I guess. Either that or you really hate Gabriel! 😅
😆George Hughes
Aug 1, 2019, 8:53 PM
George Hughes
It's strange, I find myself really excited about the idea of getting a new place
Aug 1, 2019, 8:53 PM
Callum Davies
Are you okay with that, because I know you really love that place
Aug 1, 2019, 8:52 PM
George Hughes
I could try to get a new housemate but I want to find a one bedroom so that I can focus on studies
Aug 1, 2019, 8:52 PM
George Hughes
Both
Aug 1, 2019, 8:52 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, your choice or necessity?
Aug 1, 2019, 8:51 PM
George Hughes
I've started looking for a new place :o

Aug 1, 2019, 6:23 PM
George Hughes
Please, I wanna be bothered, it'll be fun to hang out
Aug 1, 2019, 6:22 PM

Aug 1, 2019, 6:21 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I will soon. Once we get the rota started. But I wanna use my off days to see shows anyway
Aug 1, 2019, 6:20 PM
George Hughes
You're gonna need to catch up on your sleep
Aug 1, 2019, 6:19 PM
George Hughes
Oh bloody hell hahah
Aug 1, 2019, 6:19 PM

Have fun dealing with that
Jul 30, 2019, 8:47 PM

This weekend, Gabriel and I are going to prepare some pork for dinner so we thought that if I ordered some tofu and some stuff to prepare it with, you might like to get in on the fun
Jul 30, 2019, 5:54 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, why?
Jul 30, 2019, 5:52 PM
George Hughes
Do you like tofu?
Jul 30, 2019, 5:51 PM

If you miss the last 44, you can get a bus to heriot watt and walk, but that's a last resort
Jul 28, 2019, 7:58 PM

Buses are pretty bad out here late at night, that's a bit of a pain that they've got you til 11
Jul 28, 2019, 7:50 PM

Fair enough. I'll see if I can grab a pot noodle or something lol
Jul 28, 2019, 7:49 PM

Do you know how to cook lentils?
Jul 28, 2019, 7:49 PM

There's a curry in the fridge if you give me a pound ;)
Jul 28, 2019, 7:48 PM

It's either buy food or catch my bus lol
Jul 28, 2019, 7:48 PM

I honestly don't know what I'm going to do for food at this point
Jul 28, 2019, 7:48 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, okay then
Jul 28, 2019, 7:48 PM
George Hughes
He'll be here for two weeks then he's gone and the place is ours
Jul 28, 2019, 7:47 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then
Jul 28, 2019, 7:46 PM
George Hughes
Cause he likes to use the living room to study so you'll be using space that he usually uses.
Jul 28, 2019, 7:46 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine. And how come it'll cost more if I'm sleeping in the front room, by the way?
Jul 28, 2019, 7:46 PM
George Hughes
I didn't account for him being around though, sorry about that
Jul 28, 2019, 7:45 PM
George Hughes
In all fairness, it's his house too so I have to respect him. If I were him, I imagine I'd be a little uneasy about it at first too
Jul 28, 2019, 7:44 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that seems a tad unfair, if I'm being perfectly honest. It's not like I had any say in that being the case
Jul 28, 2019, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
He'll probably ask for more money knowing him 🤑

I've texted him, I'll let you know what the deal is
Jul 28, 2019, 7:41 PM
Callum Davies
Well he'll kinda have to be, otherwise I'm on the streets haha 😅
Jul 28, 2019, 7:40 PM
George Hughes
It's all good, I'll need to make sure Gabriel is okay with the door being unlocked until you get in
Jul 28, 2019, 7:38 PM
Callum Davies
Sorry 😓
Jul 28, 2019, 7:38 PM
George Hughes
Hopefully that won't cause too much of an issue
Jul 28, 2019, 7:38 PM
George Hughes
Bloody hell
Jul 28, 2019, 7:37 PM
Callum Davies
Hi George, just to let you know the next two days I'm definitely not going to be back before 8. I have like 11pm finishes 😅
Jul 28, 2019, 7:34 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I suppose 🤔
Jul 28, 2019, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
I haven't a clue, there's always the train though if it comes to it :/
Jul 28, 2019, 6:33 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, apparently. I'm stressing out about it
Jul 28, 2019, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
Shit a bus strike??
Jul 28, 2019, 6:30 PM
Callum Davies
Do you know this bus strike on Tuesday is going to affect the buses?
Jul 28, 2019, 6:29 PM
George Hughes
Sweet
Jul 27, 2019, 7:46 PM
Callum Davies
Just pulling out 😉
Jul 27, 2019, 7:46 PM

Jul 27, 2019, 7:37 PM
George Hughes

Jul 27, 2019, 7:34 PM
George Hughes
Sure thing
Jul 27, 2019, 7:33 PM
Callum Davies
I'll see what happens
Jul 27, 2019, 7:29 PM
George Hughes
Bloody hell well if you're at haymarket you could always just get a 44 to here
Jul 27, 2019, 7:28 PM
Callum Davies
There are that many delays
Jul 27, 2019, 7:28 PM
Callum Davies
Half past, but it's not even showed on the board yet
Jul 27, 2019, 7:28 PM
George Hughes
What time are you expecting to get to the station?
Jul 27, 2019, 7:27 PM
George Hughes
Lmao literally everytime I've had someone over the trains get delayed
Jul 27, 2019, 7:27 PM
Callum Davies
I think the trains are a bit delayed (when does that ever happen!) 🙄
Jul 27, 2019, 7:26 PM
George Hughes
Good stuff
Jul 27, 2019, 6:19 PM
Callum Davies
But I am using my data, so as I say, if you need me, message me via SMS if you can. Thanks x

Jul 27, 2019, 6:11 PM
Callum Davies
Hi, I'm on the train now, should be arriving at Haymarket at 7:19, then get the 7:30 train from Haymarket to Currie which should be coming in at 7:43
Jul 27, 2019, 6:10 PM
Callum Davies
Yup, according to Google maps, I no longer live at flat 15, 4 rose Terrace. It is now 81 forth view crescent haha
😮George Hughes
Jul 27, 2019, 6:01 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers, it's just so I can set my new "home" and "work" addresses on Google maps, it'll really help with planning buses and stuff
Jul 27, 2019, 6:00 PM
George Hughes
See you before long
Jul 27, 2019, 5:59 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers
Jul 27, 2019, 5:59 PM
George Hughes
81 Forth View Crescent, but I'll come meet you at the station
Jul 27, 2019, 5:58 PM
Callum Davies
Where exactly is your address? Like, what house number?
Jul 27, 2019, 5:58 PM
Callum Davies
I'm on my way to the Perth station now, so I'm using my data. Give me a good old fashioned text if you need me lol
Jul 27, 2019, 5:23 PM
Callum Davies
7:43pm if it's on time
Jul 27, 2019, 5:22 PM

Okay. I'll set a home and work to see if I can make my life easier with that. Can you drop your address again? 😅 I keep forgetting
Jul 27, 2019, 9:19 AM
George Hughes
The m tickets app is the one you want
Jul 27, 2019, 9:18 AM

Jul 27, 2019, 9:16 AM
Callum Davies
That's good. That may be my best bet. I'll work it out, I might be better off if I buy week tickets rather than individual ones. I'll see what the prices are like
Jul 27, 2019, 9:15 AM
George Hughes
Aye they do
Jul 27, 2019, 9:14 AM
Callum Davies
Bummer, do all the buses accept the Lothian app thing?
Jul 27, 2019, 9:14 AM
George Hughes
You don't need to scan it, you just show the driver the number on the screen
Jul 27, 2019, 9:14 AM
Callum Davies
My phone doesn't have NFC, but my card is contactless, so that's all good
Jul 27, 2019, 9:13 AM
George Hughes
It's exact change, they won't give you change back if you overpay
Jul 27, 2019, 9:13 AM
Callum Davies
Ooh, okay then! Perfect! I can easily get cash, it's just a case of taking out a £10 or something and buying a pack of gum
Jul 27, 2019, 9:13 AM
George Hughes
Some of them might do contact less but I'm not so sure about that so don't take my word for it
Jul 27, 2019, 9:12 AM
George Hughes
App*
Jul 27, 2019, 9:12 AM
George Hughes
If you download the lothian bus up, you can buy virtual tickets there
Jul 27, 2019, 9:12 AM
Callum Davies
Do Edinburgh buses have electronic payment, because I don't tend to carry cash? 😅
Jul 27, 2019, 9:11 AM
George Hughes
Et toi !!
Jul 26, 2019, 9:53 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, sounds like a plan. Might be what I have to do anyway, the job being the way it is. Sleep well 😁
Jul 26, 2019, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
Gotta catch dem zzzzs
Jul 26, 2019, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
I'm off anyways
Jul 26, 2019, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
But aye let's see tomorrow
Jul 26, 2019, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
The only way I can really see is if you treat it as a sleeping base and spend your weekdays days out
Jul 26, 2019, 9:51 PM
Callum Davies
But I'm too tired to work anything out now to be honest lol
Jul 26, 2019, 9:51 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, so I'm legit not trying to be unreasonable, I understand that you can't get copies of the keys cut, so we'll have to think
Jul 26, 2019, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
Oooooooooh, I don't like the sound of that...
😆George Hughes
Jul 26, 2019, 9:50 PM
George Hughes
Plz exposure me
Jul 26, 2019, 9:49 PM
George Hughes
I do all this for you and this is how you repay me?
Jul 26, 2019, 9:49 PM
Callum Davies
Will you do for exposure?
Jul 26, 2019, 9:49 PM
George Hughes
You're being so greedy ugh
Jul 26, 2019, 9:49 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but I'm not actually a choosing beggar, so I want to make it clear for fear of seeming unreasonable
😆George Hughes
Jul 26, 2019, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, we'll have a ponder tomorrow
Jul 26, 2019, 9:48 PM
George Hughes
It only works if you don't say nah jk!
Jul 26, 2019, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
Now put me on r/choosingbeggars for that sweet 7 karma
😆George Hughes
Jul 26, 2019, 9:47 PM
Callum Davies
What!? That's totally unreasonable!
Jul 26, 2019, 9:47 PM
George Hughes
🤷🏼
Jul 26, 2019, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Aye I'd rather not sacrifice my dream home
Jul 26, 2019, 9:46 PM
Callum Davies
I get you could lose the tenancy if you got found out lol
Jul 26, 2019, 9:46 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, I'm joking
Jul 26, 2019, 9:46 PM
Callum Davies
Not even sneaky get keys cut? I won't tell anyone haha
Jul 26, 2019, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
I didn't really think about that lol
Jul 26, 2019, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
Sounds good
Jul 26, 2019, 9:45 PM
Callum Davies
I'll see what I can think of, we can discuss it tomorrow maybe
Jul 26, 2019, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
Or spend the day out in town
Jul 26, 2019, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
And on days where you're off, id leave the door unlocked and you'd just have to stay in.
Jul 26, 2019, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
If that were the case, that'd be ideal
Jul 26, 2019, 9:44 PM
Callum Davies
But I'd probably be leaving the house at around the same time
Jul 26, 2019, 9:44 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, it's a bit tricky haha
Jul 26, 2019, 9:44 PM
George Hughes
No it's not my house so I can't do that
Jul 26, 2019, 9:44 PM
Callum Davies
Aah, that's a good point. Is there a timpsons or something like that in town? If you get copies cut, I'll happily pay for them
Jul 26, 2019, 9:43 PM
George Hughes
And I'd need to lock up if we're both gonna be out the house
Jul 26, 2019, 9:43 PM
George Hughes
Cause I need to leave the house at about 7ish in the mornings and I won't be back til after 5
Jul 26, 2019, 9:43 PM
George Hughes
What are we gonna do about keys?
Jul 26, 2019, 9:42 PM
George Hughes
Btw I've just had a thought
Jul 26, 2019, 9:42 PM
George Hughes
They make for good stories either way 💁🏼
Jul 26, 2019, 9:42 PM
Callum Davies
But you have no way of verifying the stories, so they could have happened?
Jul 26, 2019, 8:09 PM
Callum Davies
Although I do take everything I read on Reddit with a pinch of salt, a good portion of it just people making shit up
Jul 26, 2019, 8:09 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha sounds about right for reddit
Jul 26, 2019, 8:08 PM
Callum Davies
What do you get when you cross a joke with a rhetorical question?
😆George Hughes
Jul 26, 2019, 8:04 PM
Callum Davies
And it's stuff like "How much chicken is in a 15-piece chicken box?" And "How much is a $20 fill up bucket cost?"
Jul 26, 2019, 7:57 PM
Callum Davies
It's ask Reddit dumb things people have heard in public
Jul 26, 2019, 7:56 PM
Callum Davies
This Reddit is beautiful
Jul 26, 2019, 7:55 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, fair enough
Jul 26, 2019, 7:55 PM
George Hughes
I haven't really kept up with that tbh
Jul 26, 2019, 7:55 PM
Callum Davies
Have you heard all this new slazo and imallexx drama?
Jul 26, 2019, 7:17 PM
George Hughes
Lol tell me about it
Jul 26, 2019, 7:16 PM
Callum Davies
I'm just organising stuff for tomorrow and watch shitty Reddit videos. They're my new guilty pleasure, but they're easy to watch haha
Jul 26, 2019, 7:13 PM

Just got a text from Katy, unfortunately she's not gonna make it to Perth today, but she's gonna try to come to Edinburgh when I know my days off, so that's good
Jul 26, 2019, 7:11 PM
George Hughes
I'm busy cooking dinner so I'll chat in a while
Jul 26, 2019, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
That's good then
Jul 26, 2019, 7:09 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, we're gonna have a call tonight if she can't make it, and I suppose it's alright that she'll visit Edinburgh soon 😁
Jul 26, 2019, 7:01 PM
George Hughes
That might be better than nothing
Jul 26, 2019, 7:01 PM
Callum Davies
She has messenger, WhatsApp, what have you
Jul 26, 2019, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I can video call her
Jul 26, 2019, 6:55 PM
George Hughes
Can you do a video chat thing with her?
Jul 26, 2019, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
I'm kinda bummed it's looking like I might not get to see Katy tonight 😢
Jul 26, 2019, 6:54 PM

Jul 26, 2019, 6:53 PM
Callum Davies
Of course I would haha
Jul 26, 2019, 6:52 PM
George Hughes
Anytime, I'm sure you'd do the same for me anyways 😁
Jul 26, 2019, 6:51 PM
Callum Davies
Not a problem. I cannot stress enough how okay with that I am, and how grateful I am to you giving me a place to stay! 😅
Jul 26, 2019, 6:51 PM
George Hughes
Couch cushions should be comfy enough
Jul 26, 2019, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
That's fine then, sorry about that
Jul 26, 2019, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
It's fine, I would expect nothing less. I've got a blanket, you're already housing me, it's fine 😁
Jul 26, 2019, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
Didn't realise resits would be so soon
Jul 26, 2019, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
Gabriel my housemate has just told he's back here on Monday, so you'll be on the couch from then. I've asked him how long he's gonna be here, hopefully not long
Jul 26, 2019, 6:48 PM
Callum Davies
It's not a bad musical by any stretch of the imagination. Just the film looks horrific

Hey at least they're getting paid to make that shit
Jul 26, 2019, 6:20 PM

Good for advertising, bad if you're an animator
Jul 26, 2019, 6:19 PM
George Hughes
Proved by the sonic movie
Jul 26, 2019, 6:19 PM
George Hughes
Although it's become a good stunt for advertising
Jul 26, 2019, 6:19 PM

Oh dear, the trailer must be pretty bad
Jul 26, 2019, 6:18 PM

Jul 26, 2019, 5:49 PM

Do you think there's a chance of that happening?
Jul 26, 2019, 5:47 PM
Callum Davies
I'm imagining it will, if it doesn't get so severely ridiculed before it's release haha
Jul 26, 2019, 5:46 PM
George Hughes
Will it be in cinemas?
Jul 26, 2019, 5:43 PM

That's still Edinburgh, isn't it? 😅
Jul 26, 2019, 5:12 PM

She's welcome out here too if she wants to visit you here 💁🏼
Jul 26, 2019, 5:12 PM

Yeah, but at least it won't be the whole month before I get to see her again 😅
Jul 26, 2019, 5:10 PM

Hi George, I know you're at work, but I just got a call from the underbelly saying I got the job at the fringe! Would I possibly be able to stay at your place for a few nights until I found a place at the centre? I'd chip in a little for rent

Your code made the assumption that there was a file in the current path directory which threw dat ass in a circle

Thank you for your recognition, the main challenge was trying to write it on a phone lol
Jul 23, 2019, 5:06 PM

Wow, I just wanted you to correct my "grammar" as it were. You completely overhauled (and improved) the infrastructure. Above and beyond the call of duty haha
Jul 23, 2019, 5:05 PM
George Hughes
If you want to run it, I can write you an Ass Class
Jul 23, 2019, 5:04 PM
George Hughes
ass = Ass(direction=0, use_degrees=True)
is_moist = True

while is_moist == True:
ass.direction = (ass.direction + 1)%360

George Hughes
This is an acceptable answer
Jul 23, 2019, 4:58 PM
Callum Davies
Here we go, I'm probably gonna butcher this:

If "is_moist" = yes
then run "throw_ass_in_circle.exe"

So we've got an adult panto this evening, this is gonna be fun. It's basically the same panto, but with adult jokes, and we're all basically pranking each other. For instance, me and Damo (my colleague at the tech booth) have changed some of the sound files for the actors

Jul 15, 2019, 6:34 PM

I'm of the belief that music is based on relativity and so changing A only has an effect on those with sensitivity to absolute frequencies of pitches, basically someone who has perfect pitch in concert pitch will dislike 432Hz more than someone who only hears music with intervals
Jul 15, 2019, 5:00 PM

That's an awkward situation but it's understandable
Jul 8, 2019, 5:11 PM
Callum Davies
I know, we've had this discussion. It's not permanent, it's just during the holidays when she doesn't have any SAAS. She really struggled to find any full time work in Perth, so she eventually ended up going back to her old job in Balfron. She's gonna find something part time for during college in September.
Jul 8, 2019, 5:10 PM
George Hughes
I mean she's paying for rent so it seems silly
Jul 8, 2019, 5:05 PM
George Hughes
What's the point in her working so far away and having a flat with you? Why doesn't she work in Perth?
Jul 8, 2019, 5:04 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but even when she's not, she'll have a shift the day after, so it's not worth the money her coming down to stay so short a time. Plus I'm not always available either. It just sucks that sometimes I won't see her for like 2 weeks
Jul 8, 2019, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
Does she work every weekday?
Jul 8, 2019, 4:58 PM
George Hughes
That's a shame you're not getting to see much of her
Jul 8, 2019, 4:57 PM

I've been okay, feeling a little lonely and stressed though. Katy was round at the weekend, and had to go away again today for work, so I'm hardly overjoyed at that. But I'm surviving

A greenhouse?
Jun 26, 2019, 9:10 PM

Haha, thanks. I've separated the farm as well, which makes it much easier to breed cows and sheep by themselves. Next job is to look towards expanding the greenhouse, probably do that tomorrow

Oooh looking forward to seeing what you've done with the place

Jun 24, 2019, 8:37 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's probsbly the fix for that one,
Jun 24, 2019, 8:36 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, will do. And also the low e string seems to twang off the frets if I play it too hard. I imagine I just need to adjust the action, yes?
Jun 24, 2019, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
Then slowly let them pull back inwards
Jun 24, 2019, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
Just pull them out, away from the body, gripping them just before the neck begins on the body
Jun 24, 2019, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
Try doing that and see if it persists
Jun 24, 2019, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
Whenever I put new strings on, I stretch them so they don't have to be played in
Jun 24, 2019, 8:35 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it's just kinda like they're pinging off other metallic bits of the guitar. Mainly the clamps on the head. I assume that's just because they're brand new and that'll go away as the stings become a little more flexible
Jun 24, 2019, 8:34 PM
George Hughes
Ping?
Jun 24, 2019, 8:33 PM
George Hughes
Hmmm
Jun 24, 2019, 8:33 PM
Callum Davies
Well, the main one is that whenever I use the whammy bar the strings seem to "ping". Is that just because it's brand new, do I just need to break it in as it were
Jun 24, 2019, 8:32 PM
George Hughes
Fire away 😁

But try picking up duolingo or something cognitive to keep your brain occupied, and if your brain thinks it's doing something constructive, it won't have anything to complain about

Yeah, but if it comes to it, it wouldn't be a permanent solution. Just to pay rent whilst I looked for a job in theatre
Jun 17, 2019, 9:05 PM
George Hughes
And don't be afraid to reach out to places, although you probably know that better than me already
Jun 17, 2019, 9:04 PM

There's no doubt you'll find somewhere
Jun 17, 2019, 9:03 PM

Careful when it comes to work like that, it's a bit of a rabbit hole. Make sure you do something that makes you happy
Jun 17, 2019, 9:03 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, I know. And I'm sure it'll be fine. And at the end of the day, I can always work in Primark or somewhere to pay rent until I find something better if I need to
Jun 17, 2019, 9:02 PM

So don'tchu worry

Jun 17, 2019, 9:00 PM

I'm sure your parents would be more than happy to help if you needed an extra leg, and you've got Katy there to support you too. At the end of the day, it'll work out somehow

Just as SAAS has ended, council tax will start to come in (I'm no longer a student) and although I've got a couple of things lined up, such as joining Joe Purdy Productions on the Dundee and Aberdeen legs of their tour and applying to the underbelly during the fringe, nothing is certain at the moment, and even if I do get them, certainly not permanent. I'm just a little worried about money at the moment is all. I mean, I do have my savings, but I want to try to avoid having to dip into those as much as I can
Jun 17, 2019, 8:58 PM
George Hughes
How so?

Jun 8, 2019, 8:41 PM
Callum Davies
Also, my face has gone into a breakout due to deadline and work related stress, so that fun!

No, quite the opposite. I'm trying to smile, and not feel utterly self conscious about being in the photo. It was totally her idea, trust me. I didn't say anything against it, but it's her hair, not my decision to make 💁

Look up "A New International" on Spotify, they remind me of the Decembrists a lot, I found them because they were a part of the dark carnival, a show Katy and me went to see, but they're honestly really good, and their album the dark carnival is out on the 26th. A couple of singles from the album are already available, and their previous album come to the fabulon is amazing in my opinion, definitely give them a listen

Apr 2, 2019, 5:06 PM
George Hughes
That's very good news!
Apr 2, 2019, 5:05 PM
George Hughes
Ooooh
Apr 2, 2019, 5:05 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 2, 2019, 5:05 PM
George Hughes
Hmm?
Apr 2, 2019, 5:05 PM
George Hughes
It sounds pretty dumb hahah
Apr 2, 2019, 5:05 PM
Callum Davies
But I just got this email...
Apr 2, 2019, 5:05 PM
Callum Davies
Well of course he did 😆
Apr 2, 2019, 5:04 PM
George Hughes
I have a feeling he did that intentionally 💁🏼
Apr 2, 2019, 5:04 PM
Callum Davies
So good news
Apr 2, 2019, 5:04 PM
George Hughes
Sure
Apr 2, 2019, 4:59 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, when he wants to. Listen to "Inflatable You" and tell me the first half of that solo sounds good 😆
Apr 2, 2019, 4:56 PM
George Hughes
I guess he does hahah, but he certainly makes them sound bloody good
Apr 2, 2019, 4:55 PM
Callum Davies
He treats pianos the same way 2CELLOS treat bows
Apr 2, 2019, 4:51 PM
Callum Davies
It's so true though. He does thrash those pianos when he plays
Apr 2, 2019, 4:50 PM
George Hughes
Piano abusing 😆😆
Apr 2, 2019, 4:49 PM
Callum Davies
One of my favourite things I've ever read about him is on the back of one of his DVDs described him as "the piano-abusing Tim Minchin"
Apr 2, 2019, 4:48 PM
Callum Davies
So do a lot of people I think
Apr 2, 2019, 4:47 PM
George Hughes
Wish I could play piano like him
Apr 2, 2019, 4:47 PM
George Hughes
He has good taste :p
Apr 2, 2019, 4:47 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 2, 2019, 4:44 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 2, 2019, 4:43 PM
Callum Davies
I know Tim Minchin likes his KORGs
Apr 2, 2019, 4:41 PM
George Hughes
It's heavier than you expect it to be but it's not too heavy
Apr 2, 2019, 4:39 PM
Callum Davies
Is it light?
Apr 2, 2019, 4:39 PM
George Hughes
I brought it back from Ed, very portable
Apr 2, 2019, 4:38 PM
Callum Davies
And I like the microKORG V much
Apr 2, 2019, 4:36 PM
George Hughes
Ooooft okay it's defo dead then
Apr 2, 2019, 4:36 PM
Callum Davies
I'm sure there are anti vaxx memes on Instagram by now
Apr 2, 2019, 4:36 PM
George Hughes
Maybe it is declining a touch but the cases of measles aren't
Apr 2, 2019, 4:35 PM
Callum Davies
It has been found by the normies
Apr 2, 2019, 4:35 PM
George Hughes

Apr 2, 2019, 4:35 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, I think anti vaxx is in a definite decline
Apr 2, 2019, 4:35 PM
George Hughes
Have I shown you this btw?
Apr 2, 2019, 4:34 PM
George Hughes
Anti vax is still pretty fresh tho
Apr 2, 2019, 4:34 PM
George Hughes
That E one should have been sold over a year ago
Apr 2, 2019, 4:34 PM
Callum Davies
Should have sold these a couple weeks ago
Apr 2, 2019, 4:33 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 2, 2019, 4:33 PM
Callum Davies
I sorted by new. *THIS* was posted 3mins ago on r/memes...

Apr 2, 2019, 4:27 PM
Callum Davies
It's just so funny that this cute little bird wants to fucking kill you and your family
Apr 2, 2019, 4:25 PM
George Hughes
Why did Dulingo memes become a thing? 😂
Apr 2, 2019, 4:24 PM
Callum Davies
Fucking Duolingo memes man, why do I still find them funny?
Apr 2, 2019, 4:21 PM

This is tasty. I like what they've done with that

Apr 2, 2019, 4:11 PM
George Hughes
That is a good meme sir
Apr 2, 2019, 4:08 PM
George Hughes
It's okay, memes sustain me
Apr 2, 2019, 4:08 PM
Callum Davies
I'm doing my very best not to just flood you with memes at the moment
Apr 2, 2019, 4:03 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 2, 2019, 3:59 PM
Callum Davies
This is a prehistoric meme by now
Apr 2, 2019, 3:59 PM
Callum Davies
They changed it to r/garlicbreadmemes
Apr 2, 2019, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
What happened?
Apr 2, 2019, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
I did not?
Apr 2, 2019, 3:57 PM
Callum Davies
Did you see yesterday on r/memes?
Apr 2, 2019, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
Hehehe
Apr 2, 2019, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
He's called Ollie
Apr 2, 2019, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
And the dog's pretty cute too haha
Apr 2, 2019, 3:53 PM
George Hughes
What's he called?
Apr 2, 2019, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
I know
Apr 2, 2019, 3:53 PM
George Hughes
Awwwwwh so cuuute!!
Apr 2, 2019, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
Katy's doggo
Apr 2, 2019, 3:52 PM

Apr 2, 2019, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
Hahah
Apr 2, 2019, 3:51 PM
George Hughes
Smol potat
Apr 2, 2019, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
I feel like this is me with Katy
Apr 2, 2019, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 2, 2019, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
He could have said "What a fucking cunt" and nobody would have cared
Apr 2, 2019, 3:50 PM
Callum Davies
It does baffle me why he chose that word
Apr 2, 2019, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
Hahahah classic
Apr 2, 2019, 3:49 PM
Callum Davies
I still watch pewds on occasion, his stuff is still alright imho
Apr 2, 2019, 3:48 PM
Callum Davies
Oof

Apr 2, 2019, 3:48 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, lemmie find something I send a mate
Apr 2, 2019, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
I kinda don't watch Pewds anymore, his content seems like time waster
Apr 2, 2019, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
You're right,
Apr 2, 2019, 3:47 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, I guess. Doesn't really matter to be honest haha
Apr 2, 2019, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
It's kinda hard to judge in that sense
Apr 2, 2019, 3:40 PM
Callum Davies
To be fair, he did kinda keep going on about "but do they ever talk about my charity" during the whole fivver and wall Street journal thing
Apr 2, 2019, 3:39 PM
George Hughes
Unfortunately I think people see his charity as an attempt to clear his name
Apr 2, 2019, 3:37 PM
Callum Davies
It's just funny that there's only a massive spike when he does something wrong. Bet there isn't that for when he announces a charity event
Apr 2, 2019, 3:36 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, because of the whole fivver thing in February and then the bridge in November haha
Apr 2, 2019, 3:35 PM
George Hughes
I don't recall, that was probably because of the bridge
Apr 2, 2019, 3:28 PM
Callum Davies
It was 2017, wasn't it?
Apr 2, 2019, 3:25 PM
Callum Davies
There are massive spike for "PewDiePie" in February and November 2017 😆
Apr 2, 2019, 3:25 PM
George Hughes
Aye that was weird, I was messing about on Google trends and I saw the dips
Apr 2, 2019, 3:25 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 2, 2019, 3:25 PM
George Hughes
Bruh 😂😂
Apr 2, 2019, 3:24 PM
Callum Davies
I like your one where you said people stop giving a fuck about science during Christmas
Apr 2, 2019, 3:24 PM
Callum Davies
I like this 👌

Apr 2, 2019, 3:24 PM
George Hughes
I sold years ago for that one
Apr 2, 2019, 3:23 PM
George Hughes
Daamn that's an old one
Apr 2, 2019, 3:23 PM
Callum Davies
This meme format is going to shit. The punchlines are becoming too predictable. My advice, sell now

Apr 2, 2019, 3:22 PM
Callum Davies
Like dat boi
Apr 2, 2019, 3:21 PM
Callum Davies
Issa old meme, but it made a comeback
Apr 2, 2019, 3:21 PM
George Hughes
I missed that one, I have no stock to sell 😭
Apr 2, 2019, 3:20 PM
Callum Davies
You not been watching the meme stock market? A few days ago I'd have told you to invest in Duolingo memes, they're making a comeback. But you probably wanna sell now, it's due a crash, I reckon
Apr 2, 2019, 3:20 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha is that secretly an advert for Dulingo?
Apr 2, 2019, 3:19 PM

Error 405 - this page has self confidence issues

I was trying so hard but you wouldn't allow it 😢
Apr 2, 2019, 3:12 PM
Callum Davies
I feel like gandalf "You shall NOT compliment me!"
Apr 2, 2019, 3:11 PM
Callum Davies
Sure will haha
Apr 2, 2019, 3:11 PM
George Hughes
Ah I see, well either way, make the most of it 😁
Apr 2, 2019, 3:08 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I kinda get what you're saying, but she does study in Perth, so she may have ended up living in Perth even without me haha
Apr 2, 2019, 2:57 PM
George Hughes
She wouldn't have a reason to live there without you then 🤷🏼
Apr 2, 2019, 2:55 PM
Callum Davies
She really did haha
Apr 2, 2019, 2:53 PM
George Hughes
She wouldn't have found it without you though :p
Apr 2, 2019, 2:50 PM
Callum Davies
But it was all Katy haha
Apr 2, 2019, 2:48 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, very lucky
Apr 2, 2019, 2:48 PM
Callum Davies
And the bedroom's a little smaller, but we'll make do
Apr 2, 2019, 2:48 PM
Callum Davies
It does technically have one room less, because kitchen and living room are open plan joined, but that's fine
Apr 2, 2019, 2:47 PM
George Hughes
It is a beautiful place, you're very lucky to have found such an ideal place for that price
Apr 2, 2019, 2:47 PM
Callum Davies
£350/month, cheapest place we've ever found in Perth that isn't just a one room studio
Apr 2, 2019, 2:47 PM
Callum Davies
I always thought it was really expensive to live there, but apparently not haha
Apr 2, 2019, 2:46 PM
Callum Davies
I love the convenience of living in Perth, but I like the quiet of Abernethy. I feel like this is the best of both worlds. And architecturally speaking, I absolutely adore rose terrace. I love the way it looks, the redstone arches, it's a beautiful street 😍
Apr 2, 2019, 2:46 PM
Callum Davies
Really look forward to living there
Apr 2, 2019, 2:44 PM
Callum Davies
☺️
Apr 2, 2019, 2:30 PM
George Hughes
Yaayyy!
Apr 2, 2019, 2:30 PM
Callum Davies
I'll need to get some forms ready and buy Meggie a present on Amazon when we get to the flat, but after that, I'm all yours babe
Apr 2, 2019, 2:27 PM
George Hughes
That's alright, I'll be ready whenever you are
Apr 2, 2019, 2:26 PM
Callum Davies
Pretty much, we just need to fill out some forms. I'm doing that tomorrow. So may need to leave early ish tomorrow haha
Apr 2, 2019, 2:20 PM
George Hughes
So is it guaranteed that you'll get it?
Apr 2, 2019, 2:16 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow that's a surprise, lucky you
Apr 2, 2019, 2:16 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, we can get quite a lot of it on freegle and Freecycle and what have you, but we're allowed to decorate in this place. Which is unusual, but very welcome
Apr 2, 2019, 2:15 PM
George Hughes
Furnishing it will be a fun project 😁
Apr 2, 2019, 2:14 PM

This be it my boi

Apr 2, 2019, 2:02 PM
Callum Davies
I hope not
Apr 2, 2019, 2:02 PM
George Hughes
Is that the Rose Terrace in Michigan?
Apr 2, 2019, 2:02 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it'll be good
Apr 2, 2019, 2:01 PM
George Hughes
Ooooh congrats, I'll look forward to hearing about it!
Apr 2, 2019, 2:01 PM
Callum Davies
I can tell you all about it tonight
Apr 2, 2019, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
That's perfectly fine mate. But this will be the last time you're in this flat. We decided to go for the new place haha
Apr 2, 2019, 1:19 PM
George Hughes
Of course 😁 I'd give you cash but I only brought enough for my bus fares 💁🏼
Apr 2, 2019, 1:13 PM
Callum Davies
If you're sure haha
Apr 2, 2019, 1:12 PM
George Hughes
You're driving me about, it's the least I can do :p
Apr 2, 2019, 1:11 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine, you don't need to haha
Apr 2, 2019, 1:11 PM
George Hughes
I'll transfer you money for for it if that's cool
Apr 2, 2019, 1:10 PM
George Hughes
Okay sure, lemme know if there's any trouble getting it
Apr 2, 2019, 1:10 PM
Callum Davies
There's an Asda on the way I think. I finish at 9, so I'll still be able to get one, I should think
Apr 2, 2019, 1:09 PM
George Hughes
I can see about getting one if you're not able to?
Apr 2, 2019, 1:08 PM
Callum Davies
Looking forward to our hanging out together. I'd pick up a six pack before, but I probably won't get to a shop before 10 lol. But if I can, want me to get one for tonight?
Apr 2, 2019, 1:08 PM
George Hughes
❤️
Apr 1, 2019, 7:07 PM

Apr 1, 2019, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, I need to get driving. I'll answer any messages when I get to the flat
Apr 1, 2019, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. I'll pick you up at like 9:45-10:00 then?
Apr 1, 2019, 7:05 PM
George Hughes
I'm game for a late one if you are 💁🏼
Apr 1, 2019, 7:05 PM
Callum Davies
Your choice
Apr 1, 2019, 7:05 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, but I really want to see you again. We can still hang out if you want to do a late one, and I'll pick you up if you want
Apr 1, 2019, 7:05 PM
George Hughes
That's alright no worries

You missed a call from The Karoom.

Oh, so many times. That was my 8th time. About 4 more to go haha
Apr 1, 2019, 7:01 PM
Callum Davies
I do love wonderwall by darude
Apr 1, 2019, 7:01 PM

Yeah, in Dundee
Apr 1, 2019, 6:57 PM
Callum Davies
But it is technically copyrighted, so don't leak it haha

George Hughes
Is that in Dundee?
Apr 1, 2019, 6:57 PM
George Hughes
Hahah great
Apr 1, 2019, 6:57 PM
Callum Davies
That's a feed of the show. Not the stage, but live, I can assure you haha
Apr 1, 2019, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
Is that a college show?
Apr 1, 2019, 6:56 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 1, 2019, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. I'm happy to drop you back off in the morning, just be aware I do also need to make the trip to Balfron on the Wednesday, so I'm not sure how much of a lie in you'll be allowed haha
Apr 1, 2019, 6:54 PM
George Hughes
I'll take a sleeping bag and a camping mat
Apr 1, 2019, 6:53 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. And whenever you want. Feel free to crash if you want. An air mattress can be facilitated, if you provide one lol
Apr 1, 2019, 6:51 PM
George Hughes
What time will you want rid of me?
Apr 1, 2019, 6:51 PM
George Hughes
I'll come into town when Dad is taking Zoë in to taek wondo which is at 8
Apr 1, 2019, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
Eeh, it seems a little small to me. But the landlords are much better than our current agency, that much is clear from the get go
Apr 1, 2019, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
And yeah lemme just ask Dad
Apr 1, 2019, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Ooooh awesome, do you like it?
Apr 1, 2019, 6:48 PM
Callum Davies
So 8:00pm tomorrow at mine, yeah?
Apr 1, 2019, 6:45 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, it's with Katy and mum about what to do with the possible new flat. We viewed a place on rose terrace this morning, so discussions need to be had about what we want to do next haha
Apr 1, 2019, 6:44 PM
George Hughes
Don't tire yourself out too much!
Apr 1, 2019, 6:43 PM
Callum Davies
Sounds like a plan. I'd offer tonight but I have calls to make lol
Apr 1, 2019, 6:43 PM
George Hughes
Well sure let's catch up for a little while tomorrow evening
Apr 1, 2019, 6:42 PM
George Hughes
Goodness me!
Apr 1, 2019, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
As I say, super busy week haha
Apr 1, 2019, 5:56 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, it's no bother. Katy's away anyway, so imma be pretty bored haha. I'm in Dundee today and tomorrow, apart from the times I've just told you. Then I'm in Balfron Wednesday, and Thursday I need to be in Abernethy. Friday Saturday I've put aside for writing an essay anyway haha
Apr 1, 2019, 5:56 PM
George Hughes
We could meet up for an hour in the evening tomorrow if you like? But if you're busy I'll not take too much of your time
Apr 1, 2019, 5:54 PM
Callum Davies
I'm mostly in Dundee this week lol
Apr 1, 2019, 5:53 PM
Callum Davies
I'm free tomorrow morning, I'll have to rush off at 11, but I'm back at about 8pm tomorrow if you want. I am super busy
Apr 1, 2019, 5:52 PM
George Hughes
Just got back, I'm in Brig right now
Apr 1, 2019, 5:51 PM
Callum Davies
You're in Perth now?
Apr 1, 2019, 5:51 PM
George Hughes
No worries if you're busy 😁
Apr 1, 2019, 5:50 PM
George Hughes
I'll be going back to Ed on Friday probably
Apr 1, 2019, 5:50 PM
Callum Davies
I'll have to see. I've got a busy few days ahead of me. I'm not actually in Perth for most of this week haha. When are you here from and until?
Apr 1, 2019, 5:31 PM
George Hughes
I'm in Perth for the next few days, fancy meeting up at some point?
Apr 1, 2019, 5:26 PM
George Hughes
Awwh merci beaucoup mom ami ❤️
Mar 29, 2019, 1:53 PM
Callum Davies
Not that you need it, I'm sure you'll ace it 😉
Mar 29, 2019, 1:53 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, good luck
Mar 29, 2019, 1:52 PM
George Hughes
Anyways I gotta dash, got an interview for switching to the masters course :o
Mar 29, 2019, 1:50 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 29, 2019, 1:42 PM
George Hughes
I mean that's all anyone does in every movie set in New York 💁‍♂️
Mar 29, 2019, 1:28 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, well, mostly Katy. My input pretty much stops at me shouting at a driver! 🤣
Mar 29, 2019, 1:19 PM
George Hughes
I'll be looking forward to hearing more Katy and Callum productions :D
Mar 29, 2019, 1:16 PM
George Hughes
That's a great mindset
Mar 29, 2019, 1:16 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, kinda. But also, I kinda wanna work out how it did it
Mar 29, 2019, 1:12 PM
George Hughes
You'll be petrified to touch it again in case it breaks :P
Mar 29, 2019, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies
Haha. And yeah, I found it quite difficult. I actually got it working by accident. I was just fiddling with it, and then it started working, and I wasn't actually sure what it was I did that got it working.

Huh so they do, ASIO4ALL is actually really good but it can be a little pernickety to use
Mar 29, 2019, 12:56 PM
Callum Davies
Aah, I see. Makes sense. We use a behringer interface, and when I googled "behringer audio interface asio driver" it just pointed me towards ASIO4ALL anyway. Behringer don't seem to have an official driver for their interface, they just tell you to use the ASIO4ALL driver haha
Mar 29, 2019, 12:55 PM
George Hughes
Nah I use the my audio interface's own driver, it reduces latency like crazy
Mar 29, 2019, 12:53 PM
Callum Davies
Do you use the ASIO4ALL driver?
Mar 29, 2019, 12:52 PM

She'll be glad of the help :P

Damn autocorrect. I didn't mean to say my mic haha
Mar 29, 2019, 12:51 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that's all her, I literally just set up my mic and fixed any latency issues for her, she recorded and mixed and mastered it
Mar 29, 2019, 12:50 PM

Awesome work, very impressed. And now you have s fun little RNG to work with haha
Mar 26, 2019, 9:08 AM
George Hughes
That was a fun little project, thanks for the idea
Mar 25, 2019, 11:02 PM
George Hughes
I wrote this code to generate numbers based on the current time (the seed variable is redundant).

I then measured the occurrences of values that the generator generated and created above graphs using that data. You can see that the number of occurrences of all values are similar.

Anyway, imma head off to be for now, I is a tired boi. Good luck with the RNG, am actually really excited to see how it goes now lol. Goodnight for now 🌃 x
Mar 25, 2019, 10:28 PM
Callum Davies
It's not cheating, it's research...😳
Mar 25, 2019, 10:24 PM
Callum Davies
(Maybe see if you can find the code used for the random function in c and get some inspiration from that?)
Mar 25, 2019, 10:24 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, once you've got a functional RNG, I would think that code could be useful for all sorts of functions
Mar 25, 2019, 10:23 PM
George Hughes
I was just gonna try write a standalone random number generator but I can incorporate it into that :P
Mar 25, 2019, 10:22 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, fair enough. I would try to create a "random" number generator, then maybe use that to translate into how many letters to capitalise and where in the sentence to do so, maybe?
Mar 25, 2019, 10:21 PM
George Hughes
Cause you've challenged me to do it 💁‍♂️
Mar 25, 2019, 10:19 PM
Callum Davies
Use whatever you like, but I think it's a big task, and if the good people who wrote c have already taken the time to write a "random" function so that you don't have to, why bother haha
Mar 25, 2019, 10:19 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, obviously a computer can never truly make anything random given there will always be an element of logic to its decision, but you know what I mean
Mar 25, 2019, 10:18 PM
George Hughes
Am I allowed to use the current time?
Mar 25, 2019, 10:18 PM
George Hughes
I dunno, lets find out
Mar 25, 2019, 10:18 PM
Callum Davies
No, don't do that. You'll die. It takes so much to program something that's seemingly random, doesn't it?
Mar 25, 2019, 10:18 PM
George Hughes
Even if it means an evening of procrastination
Mar 25, 2019, 10:17 PM
George Hughes
I accept your challenge
Mar 25, 2019, 10:17 PM
Callum Davies
Wait, there's a function in c for "random"? That's cheating! You gotta program "randomness" yourself haha
Mar 25, 2019, 10:16 PM
George Hughes
And for the record, the program does use currying 🍛

Probably, I'm not too sure
Feb 27, 2019, 8:00 PM
George Hughes
Possibly, although I'm sure 7 would have a lot more updated features
Feb 27, 2019, 8:00 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, it's personal preference, eh?
Feb 27, 2019, 7:51 PM
George Hughes
Cubase 7 would have been much bettert
Feb 27, 2019, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
Hahah well that's lucky, and also unlucky
Feb 27, 2019, 7:49 PM
Callum Davies
Hehe, turns out the version of cubase 7 that was given to us was only an educational license that wouldn't have worked for us anyway, so your copy is all the more appreciated
Feb 27, 2019, 7:44 PM
George Hughes
^w^
Feb 27, 2019, 7:38 PM

Feb 27, 2019, 7:29 PM

That's the original trial, but the bottom one is the full license
Feb 27, 2019, 7:29 PM
George Hughes
It looks like it only has so many remaining starts
Feb 27, 2019, 7:26 PM
Callum Davies
That there is a full license of cubase LE5. I love ya man. Thanks so much

Nah I just noticed OBS on my desktop so I opened it up and mucked around for about five minutes, turns out it has chroma key built in so I turned the settings up really high and opened google images
Feb 27, 2019, 6:08 PM
Callum Davies
But that's really cool, how'd you do that? Got yourself a green screen?

Feb 27, 2019, 4:55 PM

Rent, or cubase? Decisions, decisions...🤔
Feb 27, 2019, 4:44 PM

😆😆
Feb 27, 2019, 4:39 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's more than a month's rent, maybe once I'm working full time at some big tech company, then I'll treat myself to things like that
Feb 27, 2019, 4:38 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, £480 when I looked. That's like a month's rent for some people, little bit more in our case haha
Feb 27, 2019, 4:37 PM
George Hughes
I'd love to but it costs an awful lot
Feb 27, 2019, 4:34 PM
Callum Davies
Well, you already have it haha. Have you never considered upgrading yourself? Cubase 10 has come out now 😅
Feb 27, 2019, 4:33 PM
George Hughes
Of course, I'm sure there's someone who needs it more than me
Feb 27, 2019, 4:32 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, are you sure?
Feb 27, 2019, 4:29 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow, well if you know anyone else who needs Cubase for their course or something, by all means gift it to them
Feb 27, 2019, 4:29 PM
Callum Davies
Actually, no code needed. the disk is all you need, according to the forums, but it just so happens that on the same day my lecturer offered us the other version 😆
Feb 27, 2019, 4:15 PM
George Hughes
I'd love to hear anything you two create with it 😁
Feb 27, 2019, 3:49 PM
George Hughes
I would say chuck the disk but I'll maybe take if off your hands incase the code does turn up
Feb 27, 2019, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
Oh that's awesome! Glad to hear it! Sorry I couldn't be of more help, I guess the code never turned up, I possibly accidentally threw it out :/
Feb 27, 2019, 3:47 PM
Callum Davies
Hehe, but Katy and I are messing around with it tonight. Ooh, and if you'd like that system disk back, we've been offered a version of cubase LE 7 by my lecturer who has a spare copy he gave to me hehe. Not that your generosity goes unappreciated
Feb 27, 2019, 3:42 PM
George Hughes
Sure thing, the forums are the only reason I haven't descended into complete madness myself :P
Feb 27, 2019, 3:35 PM

Fair enough. I've just been fighting with the midi routing personally haha
Feb 27, 2019, 2:54 PM

It'll take some time to get the hang of it, I personally memorised all the keyboard shortcuts first
Feb 27, 2019, 2:26 PM

Feb 27, 2019, 11:27 AM

Feb 13, 2019, 8:29 PM

It's okay, I can't guarantee I still have it but fingers crossed it's there somwhere
Feb 13, 2019, 8:26 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, that's great. Thanks so much for lending us the disk
Feb 13, 2019, 8:25 PM
George Hughes
I have no idea where the code will be if I'm honest, but I believe my parents are in the process of clearing out my room so if they find any paperwork they'll let me know
Feb 13, 2019, 8:24 PM
George Hughes
I don't have a timetable for that day yet but it won't cause me any bother either way
Feb 13, 2019, 8:23 PM
Callum Davies
Hey buddy, so we finally got around to installing the cubase software onto Katy's laptop, and turns out that there is a code after all needed to activate the permanent software license. It's given us a trail license of the software at the moment, but I don't suppose you could think where the paperwork that came with the disk would be, do you? Because that'd have the code we need, I'm pretty sure. I'm assuming you'll not have redeemed the license key for this cubase, would you? Given this is your spare
Feb 13, 2019, 4:39 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, and by the way, it's the 19th November is when we're seeing the show, which is a Tuesday. So I'm not sure if that affects things or not

I'll see if I can get a hold of the recording for you though. Maybe by means of a midnight heist on the college

Well if you can somehow sneak me a copy, or if I could buy one, then please lemme know
Jan 18, 2019, 2:09 PM

Jan 18, 2019, 2:09 PM

I think it's being recorded, but I don't know how rights to the recording in regards to copyright and such will work
Jan 18, 2019, 2:06 PM

Will anyone be filming it?
Jan 18, 2019, 2:06 PM

Oh, the actors are great! You should see be our guest, and the final scene with belle and the beast; right in the feels 😅

That's probably why it's so hectic 😆😆
Jan 18, 2019, 1:58 PM

It's just a hectic production. But I suppose technically the director is in charge of that sort of stuff. But not like a big boss person, no. We all kinda just work together as equals
Jan 18, 2019, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
Do you have one person in charge of organisation?
Jan 18, 2019, 12:22 PM

Busy haha, very busy. But it's okay, if a little unorganised at times, admittedly
Jan 18, 2019, 7:37 AM

Full scale operation then! How do you find working with such big groups?
Jan 18, 2019, 12:14 AM

Ooh, so many. A cast fully of about 30, and a crew of probs 10/15
Jan 17, 2019, 11:59 PM

Oooh neat, how many folk are involved?
Jan 17, 2019, 11:56 PM

Have you had your college results back?

Hey so it doesn't look like we'll be eating at the Kinnears anymore since they apparently stop serving food at 6. I'm going to chat to my grandparents to figure out arrangements but I'm not sure what's happening with dinner now. We've got tickets sorted for you though. They were sold out but mum and I spoke nicely with them :p

George Hughes
If this doesn't work, you're totally welcome to my account
Dec 23, 2018, 2:11 PM

What solution is that then, and we'd need 4 different accounts, which one would Keir use? Alex's doesn't work anymore, and that's the one he used to use
Dec 23, 2018, 2:11 PM
George Hughes

Dec 23, 2018, 2:11 PM
George Hughes
Hahah if you like, but first there's a solution you could try if you like, and also if you like I can set up a server and we can play all 4 of us?
Dec 23, 2018, 2:10 PM
Callum Davies
Well, Keir's using my Minecraft account, and I'd quite like to play with him, and Alex's old account that we used to used doesn't seem to be working, so I don't suppose I could use yours, could I? 😅
Dec 23, 2018, 2:08 PM
George Hughes
Sure 💁
Dec 23, 2018, 2:02 PM

When you wanting to go for this pint and catch up then? I am in Abernethy from tomorrow, but that doesn't change the fact that during that time I will still own a flat in Perth! 😆 I'm sure mum wouldn't mind if I spent one night in the flat. Maybe we could go out in Perth and stay over the flat? Just an idea 💁🏻

Callum Davies
Yeah, but I got better.

Anyway, I think Katy's wanting to go off to bed, and I should probably get some sleep too, so I'll message you soon, and look forward to seeing you in December. But for now, I sleeb! 😴
Nov 16, 2018, 12:15 AM
George Hughes
Good stuff, no one should be satisfied living after seeing something like that
Nov 16, 2018, 12:14 AM
Callum Davies
I killed myself there and then
Nov 16, 2018, 12:11 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, I saw someone doing fortnite dances in ice factory the other day.

Callum Davies
"No, I fucking hate Tik Tok" I think I'm about ready to propose! 😆
Nov 16, 2018, 12:08 AM
George Hughes
As long as she doesn't do tik tok videos it's all good
Nov 16, 2018, 12:07 AM
Callum Davies
I'm joking, obviously. She can like falling in reverse if she really wants to 💁🏻
Nov 16, 2018, 12:07 AM
George Hughes
I can sense the power of the yeeting that is about to happen
Nov 16, 2018, 12:07 AM
Callum Davies
She must get yeeted
Nov 16, 2018, 12:07 AM
George Hughes
Daaaamn
Nov 16, 2018, 12:07 AM

Nov 16, 2018, 12:06 AM
George Hughes
Oh the one with all the fortnite dances
Nov 16, 2018, 12:06 AM
Callum Davies
Nah, the bad boys one, fam

Nov 16, 2018, 12:05 AM
Callum Davies
"Oh, that's such a good song!" 🤦
Nov 16, 2018, 12:05 AM
Callum Davies
And she was like
Nov 16, 2018, 12:05 AM
Callum Davies
Because I asked her to get the song for the meme
Nov 16, 2018, 12:05 AM
Callum Davies
I was talking to Katy
Nov 16, 2018, 12:05 AM

George Hughes

Nov 15, 2018, 11:58 PM
George Hughes
This is a dab
Nov 15, 2018, 11:58 PM
Callum Davies
Dab away the haters
Nov 15, 2018, 11:57 PM
George Hughes
You call that a dab?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:57 PM
Callum Davies

Nov 15, 2018, 11:57 PM
George Hughes
Geddit?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:57 PM
George Hughes
It's thumbs down the most negative dab I've ever seen
Nov 15, 2018, 11:57 PM
Callum Davies
And no
Nov 15, 2018, 11:57 PM
Callum Davies
Don't let PewDiePie say that

The first gif
Nov 15, 2018, 11:56 PM
Callum Davies
It's a snigger.
Nov 15, 2018, 11:56 PM
George Hughes
Is that a dab?

Nov 15, 2018, 11:56 PM
George Hughes
And I'm doubtful yeet'll ever happen again :p
Nov 15, 2018, 11:55 PM
Callum Davies
Katy's genuinely laughing. That's the first time I've ever made her genuinely laugh by using the word 'yeet'
Nov 15, 2018, 11:55 PM
George Hughes
Yeeeeet
Nov 15, 2018, 11:54 PM
Callum Davies
We should yeet him into a pile of fish fingers and mars bars, because irony
Nov 15, 2018, 11:54 PM
George Hughes
Veeery nice
Nov 15, 2018, 11:53 PM

George Hughes
Wonderful 👏👏
Nov 15, 2018, 11:53 PM
Callum Davies
In fact, I'd pay you for the privilege
Nov 15, 2018, 11:53 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, we'd do that for free
Nov 15, 2018, 11:53 PM
George Hughes
I do not require self yeeting at this timet
Nov 15, 2018, 11:53 PM
George Hughes
Would it be possible to yeet Jamie Oliver?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:52 PM
Callum Davies
Self yeeting costs extra
Nov 15, 2018, 11:52 PM
George Hughes
I do know something that could do with some yeeting
Nov 15, 2018, 11:52 PM
George Hughes
I'm fact
Nov 15, 2018, 11:52 PM
George Hughes
Wow I'm very grateful for the offer
Nov 15, 2018, 11:52 PM
Callum Davies
You need something yeeted? Bring it to us, and we shall yeet it
Nov 15, 2018, 11:52 PM
George Hughes
Very nice
Nov 15, 2018, 11:52 PM
Callum Davies
We run a home yeeting business
Nov 15, 2018, 11:51 PM
George Hughes
May I yeet on your balcony?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:51 PM
George Hughes
Excellent
Nov 15, 2018, 11:51 PM
Callum Davies
Kinda. Mainly for yeeting purposes
Nov 15, 2018, 11:51 PM
George Hughes
Still a balcony💁🏼 do you use it at all?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:50 PM
Callum Davies
It's legit like 2x4! 😆
Nov 15, 2018, 11:50 PM
Callum Davies
Of course I wouldn't. And yes, a very small one
Nov 15, 2018, 11:49 PM
George Hughes
You have a balcony??
Nov 15, 2018, 11:49 PM
George Hughes
And also
Nov 15, 2018, 11:49 PM
George Hughes
Daaaamn you wouldn't actually yeet her off the balcony would you?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:49 PM
Callum Davies
Jokingly, of course
Nov 15, 2018, 11:48 PM
Callum Davies
I'm pretty sure I've said the sentence "if I come home and the dishes aren't done I shall yeet you off the balcony" to her before
Nov 15, 2018, 11:48 PM
George Hughes
As it should be 😎
Nov 15, 2018, 11:47 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, almost consistently never
Nov 15, 2018, 11:47 PM
George Hughes
Does she appreciate it?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:46 PM
Callum Davies
I use it so much with Katy
Nov 15, 2018, 11:46 PM
George Hughes
Yeeeeet
Nov 15, 2018, 11:46 PM
Callum Davies
You can never use it too much
Nov 15, 2018, 11:46 PM
George Hughes
Yeet, maybe I use that word a little too much 😂
Nov 15, 2018, 11:46 PM
Callum Davies
I love that your autocorrect turned it into yeet 😆
Nov 15, 2018, 11:45 PM
George Hughes
I don't know why it corrected to that
Nov 15, 2018, 11:45 PM
George Hughes

Nov 15, 2018, 11:43 PM
George Hughes
From Morty's mind blowers
Nov 15, 2018, 11:42 PM
Callum Davies
Hmm, I shall have to remind myself of that character
Nov 15, 2018, 11:42 PM
George Hughes
In that gif
Nov 15, 2018, 11:42 PM
George Hughes
Is it just me or does Pewds remind you of the man from the moon in that Rick and Morty episode?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:42 PM
Callum Davies
Will do 👌🏻
Nov 15, 2018, 11:41 PM

Gotta work on your meme precision
Nov 15, 2018, 11:40 PM
Callum Davies
Huh, how about that? I was still a month out though
Nov 15, 2018, 11:40 PM
George Hughes
April
Nov 15, 2018, 11:38 PM
George Hughes
Huh you're right
Nov 15, 2018, 11:38 PM
Callum Davies
The big goog
Nov 15, 2018, 11:38 PM
George Hughes
I shall consult the great oracle of Goog
Nov 15, 2018, 11:38 PM
Callum Davies
Admittedly it does feel like a long time ago, but then again spaget and Ugandan knuckles feel even further away 🤔
Nov 15, 2018, 11:37 PM
George Hughes
Maybe.. But I've got it in my head that it wasn't this year 🤔
Nov 15, 2018, 11:36 PM
Callum Davies
No, surely not? E was definitely after spaget and Ugandan knuckles, surely?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:36 PM
George Hughes
Was it not last year?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:35 PM
George Hughes
E was a long long time ago
Nov 15, 2018, 11:35 PM
Callum Davies
When was E? I feel like that might have been around June/July time?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:35 PM
George Hughes
Implying that we've run out 😢
Nov 15, 2018, 11:34 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, so many old memes resurfaced with a spoopy twist in October
Nov 15, 2018, 11:33 PM
George Hughes
Oh god, please don't let it be 😦
Nov 15, 2018, 11:33 PM
Callum Davies
Have we...run out of memes!? 😱
Nov 15, 2018, 11:32 PM
George Hughes
🤔
Nov 15, 2018, 11:30 PM
George Hughes
I don't think there's been any big ones since
Nov 15, 2018, 11:30 PM
George Hughes
True
Nov 15, 2018, 11:30 PM
Callum Davies
So did moth though 🤔
Nov 15, 2018, 11:30 PM
George Hughes
Calcium died long before Halloween 😂
Nov 15, 2018, 11:30 PM
Callum Davies
Either that or calcium
Nov 15, 2018, 11:29 PM
Callum Davies
I have no idea. Last big meme I can think of is moth
Nov 15, 2018, 11:29 PM
George Hughes
What was last month's big meme?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:29 PM
Callum Davies
The presh mems
Nov 15, 2018, 11:29 PM
Callum Davies

Nov 15, 2018, 11:28 PM

Can't remember 💁🏼
Nov 15, 2018, 11:28 PM
George Hughes
Hmm
Nov 15, 2018, 11:28 PM
Callum Davies
Or was spaget episode 2?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:28 PM
George Hughes
I think that's exactly what he did
Nov 15, 2018, 11:28 PM
Callum Davies
Because didn't he do bike cuck, loss and spaget?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:28 PM
George Hughes
Daamn nearly a year of 👏 👏
Nov 15, 2018, 11:28 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I think it may have been?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:27 PM
George Hughes
Was January the first meme review? :o
Nov 15, 2018, 11:27 PM
Callum Davies
Was bike cuck January as well?
Nov 15, 2018, 11:27 PM
George Hughes
Ahh you might be right, need to get a meme calender for the whole year on my wall
Nov 15, 2018, 11:25 PM
Callum Davies
actually, wasn't Uganda knuckles more February? January was the month of spaget, if memory serves me correctly 🤔
Nov 15, 2018, 11:25 PM
George Hughes
Very
Nov 15, 2018, 11:24 PM
Callum Davies

Hahah wow nostalgia back to January
Nov 15, 2018, 11:24 PM
Callum Davies
I feel you, brudda
Nov 15, 2018, 11:24 PM
Callum Davies
I feel like that's almost a Uganda knuckles meme there
Nov 15, 2018, 11:23 PM
Callum Davies
I feel you, brother. 😑
Nov 15, 2018, 11:23 PM
George Hughes
Although bloody hell there's a lot of coursework to do right now 🙄
Nov 15, 2018, 11:22 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, look at you! 🙄😆
Nov 15, 2018, 11:21 PM
George Hughes
My exams finish on the 13th I think 😏
Nov 15, 2018, 11:18 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, haha. They're working us to the bone! Ah well, cèst la vie 💁🏻
Nov 15, 2018, 10:34 PM
George Hughes
Jeez you're working right the way up until Christmas almost 🙄
Nov 15, 2018, 10:33 PM
George Hughes
Yeah we should defo have a meet with Kyle as well!
Nov 15, 2018, 10:32 PM
Callum Davies
'Ello! I've just been reliably informed by my colleagues that we don't actually finish classes until the 21st! 😅 Doesn't stop us from doing evenings though, I suppose 💁🏻
Nov 15, 2018, 10:26 PM
Callum Davies
That's gives us loads of wiggle room then, that's good. It'll be good to have you back. We'll need to arrange a gathering with Kyle as well 😊
Nov 15, 2018, 10:16 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. Hopefully I'll have caught up with all my work by then haha
Nov 15, 2018, 10:15 PM
George Hughes
Possibly earlier if I find myself with nothing to do here
Nov 15, 2018, 10:14 PM
George Hughes
Oh definitely 😎 I don't know a date yet but I'm sure it'll be around the 18th
Nov 15, 2018, 10:14 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that'd be awesome. I've mentioned that to her, she's not entirely sure what day she's going down on yet. Do you know when you're in Brig from? Because of course you need to meet Katy, but I reckon a night just the two of us is also in order, eh? 😅
Nov 15, 2018, 10:12 PM
George Hughes
If she could stick around one more night, there's a gig at the Caley on the 22nd, we could go for a drink before that and meet/catch up before I play?
Nov 15, 2018, 10:08 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah! When are you heading down, because you've still to meet Katy! She's been dying to meet you; I have told her about you once or twice. Don't worry, all good things! As I say, she's going off to Stirling/Glasgow way for Christmas, but that's not till like 20th maybe, probably like 22nd/23rd, so hopefully we can align our dates! 😅
Nov 15, 2018, 10:07 PM
George Hughes
Awwh you too, and I miss you sometimes, but as I've told you before, I'll always be here for ya, no matter how long you don't message me for :P
Anyways I'm looking forward to spending Christmas with my family!
Nov 15, 2018, 10:05 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I know, you're a great friend. I felt really bad when I realised how much time I'd let pass without dropping you a message! 😅 And I do try to visit home when I can, and I'm spending Christmas there, and Katy with her's
Nov 15, 2018, 10:01 PM
George Hughes
I'm sure you already do, but call your parents from time to time, they'll appreciate it more than you know :p
Nov 15, 2018, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
Awwh I guess it's a part of life, but remember you're only a phone call or a message away😁 💁🏼
Nov 15, 2018, 9:59 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. But missing some people, like mum and Kyle and you to be honest! 😅
Nov 15, 2018, 9:58 PM
George Hughes
Hahah glad you're happy 😁
Nov 15, 2018, 9:57 PM
Callum Davies

Nov 15, 2018, 9:57 PM
Callum Davies
Yup. But also living with this nugget, so swings and roundabouts! 😆
Nov 15, 2018, 9:56 PM
George Hughes
That's class, it feels good to be standing on your own two feet eh
Nov 15, 2018, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yes. I still visit home, of course, but I do properly live in Perth now. With Katy! 😅
Nov 15, 2018, 9:54 PM
George Hughes
Is that your permanent residence now? :p
Nov 15, 2018, 9:53 PM
George Hughes
That's awesome!
Nov 15, 2018, 9:53 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yes, very much so. We're only 2 minutes away from everything, it's very convenient! 😁
Nov 15, 2018, 9:53 PM
George Hughes
I can imagine! Living in the centre of Edinburgh last year was weird like that. Are you enjoying living there?
Nov 15, 2018, 9:52 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, it still feels new! 😅 It's kinda still weird to be living in Perth so close to everything
Nov 15, 2018, 9:27 PM
George Hughes
I'd love to!! It'll be great to see your new place, even tho it ain't that new anymore
Nov 15, 2018, 9:20 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, yeah! You bet! Too busy! And yeah, pub sounds good. BUT, how about a pub in Perth, eh? You can stay round the new gaff for the night 😁
Nov 15, 2018, 8:57 PM
George Hughes
Life is good but busy, I'm sure it's the same for you
Nov 15, 2018, 8:56 PM
George Hughes
Hey 😁 it has been waaaay too long! I was thinking the other day that we should go down the pub at least twice over Christmas for some mandatory catching up!
Nov 15, 2018, 8:56 PM
Callum Davies
Hiya, it's been too long! How's life in general? I'm so sorry, we're so long overdue a catch up! 😅
Nov 15, 2018, 8:46 PM
George Hughes
oui oui

Callum Davies
It went great, and yeah, keeps me out the flat I can't afford to heat! 😆
Nov 7, 2018, 9:29 PM
George Hughes
It's good to be busy eh
Nov 7, 2018, 9:27 PM
George Hughes
Oooh how did it go?
Nov 7, 2018, 9:26 PM
Callum Davies
Just did a "gig" last week, in fact
Nov 7, 2018, 9:11 PM
Callum Davies
I've been working a lot more
Nov 7, 2018, 9:10 PM
George Hughes
Is that a good thing for you?
Nov 7, 2018, 9:08 PM
George Hughes
I'm not surprised!
Nov 7, 2018, 9:08 PM
Callum Davies
It's certainly more full-on! XD
Nov 7, 2018, 9:05 PM
George Hughes
Is second year better than first?
Nov 7, 2018, 9:00 PM
George Hughes
How's college?
Nov 7, 2018, 9:00 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, fair enough
Nov 7, 2018, 8:33 PM

Nov 7, 2018, 8:32 PM
Callum Davies
And thanks 😆 it's only there for a day
Nov 7, 2018, 8:31 PM
Callum Davies
Looks pretty similar to a speakon imo
Nov 7, 2018, 8:31 PM
George Hughes
I'm digging the new profile pic
Nov 7, 2018, 8:31 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, awesome
Nov 7, 2018, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
Pretty handy
Nov 7, 2018, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
It can be xlr or a jack
Nov 7, 2018, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
Ohh no it's a multi purpose input
Nov 7, 2018, 8:30 PM
Callum Davies
On the left, that's a speakon, right? It doesn't look like an XLR
Nov 7, 2018, 8:29 PM
George Hughes
I'm not seeing the speakon input
Nov 7, 2018, 8:29 PM
Callum Davies
It appears to have a speakon input 🤔
Nov 7, 2018, 8:28 PM
George Hughes
I don't see why not, although I can't vouch for it specifically
Nov 7, 2018, 8:28 PM
George Hughes
But behringer are good in my experience

Katy's now looking at the Behringer U-PHORIA UM2? Know of it? Any good?
Nov 7, 2018, 8:21 PM
George Hughes
Scarlett are good, simple but they do the trick. I know the college has a load of them
Nov 7, 2018, 8:20 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, decent. Well, that'd be very cash money of you! 😆 And Katy says that she's been looking at Scarlett interfaces 🤔
Nov 7, 2018, 8:14 PM
George Hughes
I got a spare cause I bought a new interface
Nov 7, 2018, 8:12 PM
George Hughes
I'll dig out the disc, but I'm not sure if it has a license key on it
Nov 7, 2018, 8:12 PM
George Hughes
Maybe a scarlett?
Nov 7, 2018, 8:11 PM
George Hughes
It doesn't, but there's plenty of affordable ones that do
Nov 7, 2018, 8:11 PM
Callum Davies
Does the lexicon alpha have phantom power capabilities?
Nov 7, 2018, 8:05 PM
Callum Davies
Stagg IMP-600 dynamic cardioid microphone. So no phantom power needed, right? But she says she might want to record her violin as well, which would need a condenser microphone (I recommend her a C-1 😉) so maybe worth getting a unit with phantom power anyway?
Nov 7, 2018, 8:03 PM
Callum Davies
Are you sure? That'd be awesome my man. Are you sure you wouldn't want some money for it, given licences do cost! Also, I can look online if she needs phantom power. She doesn't reckon she does, though
Nov 7, 2018, 7:58 PM
George Hughes
I might have a spare copy of cubase sitting around somewhere but you'll need to wait til Christmas for that as I won't be back in Perth :p
Nov 7, 2018, 7:55 PM
George Hughes
I bought the Lexicon Alpha, but depending on what mic she is going to use, you might want something with phantom power
Nov 7, 2018, 7:54 PM
Callum Davies
Hi George, we're looking into setting up a home recording studio of sorts for Katy to use on her course. I know you have a very effective setup that wields spectacular results (with a lot of talent, of course!) we're looking into cubase interfaces so that we can get the software bundled in "free" as well. I know that's how you got cubase, was just wondering which particular unit it was you got? Cheers 😉

But aye his videos are super interesting but you have to watch with the intent of learning

Wow, they look hardcore. I've just looked em up now. I'll give them a subscribe
Aug 5, 2018, 12:24 AM
George Hughes
I need it when I'm watching three blue one brown
Aug 5, 2018, 12:23 AM
Callum Davies
Hmm, I'd never considered that. That would be really useful, come to think of it. I'll try that, thanks 😉
Aug 5, 2018, 12:22 AM
George Hughes
Even just doodling along with him helps
Aug 5, 2018, 12:20 AM
George Hughes
Pencil and pad really help ngl
Aug 5, 2018, 12:20 AM
Callum Davies
I feel like I get like 80% of it, but sometimes he just makes me go "what!?" Especially when he goes into the really theoretical and just purest mathematics. Although, I did feel like I was following him all the way in his video explaining how there are different sizes of infinities.
Aug 5, 2018, 12:19 AM

Aug 4, 2018, 5:28 PM

Ha ha, fair enough. We will be proactive, I promise haha
Aug 4, 2018, 5:28 PM
George Hughes
And my flatmate from last year hasn't been very proactive and he's still looking
Aug 4, 2018, 5:27 PM
George Hughes
No worries.. It's just from last year I recall not being as proactive as I could have and I ended up in expensive student halls
Aug 4, 2018, 5:27 PM
Callum Davies
Thanks for all the advice 😉
Aug 4, 2018, 5:25 PM

Yeah, I guess. Eager, but not uninformed

Aug 4, 2018, 5:25 PM

Aug 4, 2018, 5:25 PM
George Hughes
Obviously do your research
Aug 4, 2018, 5:25 PM
George Hughes
Trust me you want to be eager
Aug 4, 2018, 5:25 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, we will! But won't being too eager make us look like, I dunno, shmucks, basically. Like an easy target to get ripped off
Aug 4, 2018, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
And don't leave ANYTHING a moment later than possible
Aug 4, 2018, 5:24 PM

Get a business card at the viewing
Aug 4, 2018, 5:23 PM
George Hughes
A word of advice, as soon as you see somewhere suitable, get a viewing for it straight away and act really, really interested in it.
Aug 4, 2018, 5:23 PM
Callum Davies
Not yet, we're in the process of looking
Aug 4, 2018, 5:20 PM
George Hughes
Did you find a flat??
Aug 4, 2018, 5:20 PM
George Hughes
Aye that's a good way to be
Aug 4, 2018, 5:19 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, a lil bit, but I'm kinda getting myself ready for the fact that I'm moving out soon, and I can call them whenever I like, so it's not that bad
Aug 4, 2018, 5:18 PM
George Hughes
I bet you're missing them
Aug 4, 2018, 5:18 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it's great. And not really, they've been on holiday for about a week before that, so I had about a day and a half of seeing them, then I was off to Katy's! 😆
Aug 4, 2018, 5:08 PM
George Hughes
Nice break from your parents? :p
Aug 4, 2018, 5:07 PM

Awh cool, are you enjoying that?
Aug 4, 2018, 5:07 PM

That's cool, I'll see about it. I'm actually up at Katy's for a wee while at the moment
Aug 4, 2018, 5:06 PM

Which you're welcome to come along to 😁
Aug 4, 2018, 5:06 PM

Aug 4, 2018, 4:48 PM
George Hughes
I might do once everything has calmed down again 😁
Aug 4, 2018, 4:45 PM
Callum Davies
But you should get it. You can play with a controller, and hey, it's free! What have you got to lose? Plus, we could do duos
Aug 4, 2018, 3:31 PM
Callum Davies
Depends who you're playing against! 😜
Aug 4, 2018, 3:22 PM

Is it hard?

Aug 4, 2018, 3:09 PM

It's alright. Just learning the controls and game mechanics at the moment loo
Aug 4, 2018, 3:09 PM

Are you enjoying it? I don't play it but I like watching folk play
Aug 4, 2018, 2:53 PM
George Hughes
Eww no I don't have fortnite
Aug 4, 2018, 2:53 PM

Aug 2, 2018, 10:16 PM

I guess it is considered the Highlands
Aug 2, 2018, 10:16 PM
George Hughes
I dunno if you'd really consider Oban the Highlands 😂 you might be right
Aug 2, 2018, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
I thought Oban was in the Highlands! 😅
Aug 2, 2018, 9:12 PM
George Hughes
We're not even in the Highlands, this part of the country is just a little disconnected 🙄
Aug 2, 2018, 9:11 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. Makes sense for when you're up in the spotty connections of the Highlands
Aug 2, 2018, 9:09 PM
George Hughes
Plus doesn't have all the flashy bits and bobs
Aug 2, 2018, 9:08 PM
George Hughes
It saves data and it's able to send messages even with the worst connections
Aug 2, 2018, 9:08 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that's fine. I was just playing my turn because I hadn't played in a while. Why are you on messenger lite?
Aug 2, 2018, 9:06 PM

Can't play now cause messenger lite doesn't let you play games, I'll do it once I'm back from Oban

I guess, but at the same time, I kinda get where she's coming from. Cuz sometimes you do want to do something, but you can lose motivation. Especially at the gym. It really can help to have someone else to help you keep each other motivated

I feel like that's the difference between the two. Like, Katy's looking to lose a bit of weight, but she's told me she lacks motivation. So she's asked me to kinda force her to come to the gym with me, because she wants the push to actually get in there. I dunno, I'm not sure I'm making myself very well understood 😆

I shall take a day to try and familiarise myself with it, and try and have at least a working knowledge of it by the time of the stream/ recording
Jul 13, 2018, 11:35 PM
George Hughes
I guess try it and see
Jul 13, 2018, 11:34 PM
Callum Davies
Nice, obs seems to be the way to go
Jul 13, 2018, 11:34 PM

I don't know x split
Jul 13, 2018, 11:34 PM
George Hughes
And I believe it's free
Jul 13, 2018, 11:34 PM
Callum Davies
Or xsplit could work as well, right?
Jul 13, 2018, 11:34 PM
George Hughes
And multiple sound inputs
Jul 13, 2018, 11:34 PM
George Hughes
Like your web cam
Jul 13, 2018, 11:34 PM
George Hughes
And itll let you record with an overlay
Jul 13, 2018, 11:33 PM
Callum Davies
Nice
Jul 13, 2018, 11:33 PM

It's usually for streaming but you can record with it
Jul 13, 2018, 11:33 PM
George Hughes
Open Broadcasting Software
Jul 13, 2018, 11:33 PM
Callum Davies
OBS?
Jul 13, 2018, 11:33 PM
George Hughes
Use OBS
Jul 13, 2018, 11:33 PM
George Hughes
Wait
Jul 13, 2018, 11:33 PM
Callum Davies
Isn't there a watermark and/or restrains on how long you can record in a single recording otherwise?
Jul 13, 2018, 11:33 PM
Callum Davies
Don't you need to pay for the full version of camstudio as well?
Jul 13, 2018, 11:32 PM
Callum Davies
Mind you, I think the full, lifetime licence of bandicam is only $30, however much that is in pounds, so not too much of a loss
Jul 13, 2018, 11:32 PM
George Hughes
Camstuduo!
Jul 13, 2018, 11:31 PM

For my computer
Jul 13, 2018, 11:31 PM

But I may need to invest in a screen capture software
Jul 13, 2018, 11:31 PM

I've an inkling of how to record team speak

AHH, I'm sure I'm not the only one who appreciates your jokes. We should stream rocket league some time

George Hughes
You know I'm glad to hear at least one person does 😇
Jul 13, 2018, 11:27 PM

No, your jokes are awful, that's why I love them! 😁
Jul 13, 2018, 11:26 PM

I wouldn't blame you if you just cried
Jul 13, 2018, 11:26 PM

This is crit1kal's IMDb page, by the way

George Hughes
Btw do you play any chess?
Jul 13, 2018, 11:20 PM
George Hughes
If you put too much priority to the recording software, the game lags and the mouse and keyboard isn't taken into account very quickly
Jul 13, 2018, 11:20 PM
George Hughes
I mean it depends which program you did that to
Jul 13, 2018, 11:19 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I thought it would be a good idea to put the program into realtime priority, because that means more power goes to it right?

Why did I momentarily forget how computers work? 😆
Jul 13, 2018, 11:18 PM
George Hughes
Mostly the Internet probably lmao
Jul 13, 2018, 11:17 PM
Callum Davies
I can also record in 1080p @ 60fps for a recording, for exactly the same reason. But I gotta stick to 720p @ 30fps for streams, otherwise my laptop and internet start to cry
Jul 13, 2018, 11:13 PM
George Hughes
Aye that'd be a struggle for my laptop even :p
Jul 13, 2018, 11:12 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. Well, a microphone at any rate. My laptop doesn't seem to have the power to render both gameplay and a facecam, not for streaming at any rate. I guess I could do it for recording though, since it could have time to render both the video streams separately and stitch them back together after I've hit stop on a recording, but it's gotta do it live for a stream! 😅
Jul 13, 2018, 11:09 PM
George Hughes
All the ingredients are there 💁 It's a good skill to be able to talk to a camera I think
Jul 13, 2018, 11:07 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that's what I was thinking. Because I've found myself with so much free time recently, a capture card from a little while ago, and I guess I've just kinda gone "Fuck it, why not? It'll be a larf!" 😜
Jul 13, 2018, 11:06 PM
George Hughes
That'd be a good way to spend time!
Jul 13, 2018, 11:04 PM
Callum Davies
They'd just be for fun, for my own entertainment more than anyone else's! 😅
Jul 13, 2018, 11:04 PM
Callum Davies
I wouldn't monetize the videos though
Jul 13, 2018, 11:03 PM
Callum Davies
That's kinda why I've been flirting with the idea of streaming recently, as a kind of stepping stone, maybe
Jul 13, 2018, 11:03 PM
Callum Davies
Not gonna lie, considering maybe starting that shit back up in a low-key sort of way. I feel like it could be something to keep me busy, and I'm certainly more equipped to take criticism now then I was back then
Jul 13, 2018, 11:02 PM
George Hughes
Fun times bruv
Jul 13, 2018, 11:02 PM

Remember when we were sat round the table with our laptops all recording our game play
Jul 13, 2018, 11:02 PM
George Hughes
This is like when we were doing youtube all those years ago 😁
Jul 13, 2018, 11:01 PM
Callum Davies
But I seek to learn
Jul 13, 2018, 11:00 PM
Callum Davies
Because right now all I know how to do is stream gameplay from my PS3 with live audio commentary over it, and not much else aside from that at the moment
Jul 13, 2018, 11:00 PM
Callum Davies
I'll also need to work out different configurations of my rig for different things; recording and streaming pc gameplay as well, getting audio from team chat, integrating face cam and on screen comments, little stuff like that
Jul 13, 2018, 10:59 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, there are certainly good and bad bits of the stream today! 😅 And not on your life! 😆
Jul 13, 2018, 10:57 PM
George Hughes
You could just become a minecraft channel
Jul 13, 2018, 10:56 PM

AHH, that may be a problem

For sure, you gonna start a twitch?
Jul 13, 2018, 10:31 PM

Well, yeah, but it's also a skill, and I imagine I will get better as I do more streams

Yeah, it went alright. I would say about a 30% on the moist meter. Room for improvement, certainly, but an improvement on yesterday. The recordings on my channel if you'd like to peruse it's contents

On my way back up from the bus shelter (just to double check the bus times) a couple of edge lords shouted to me "You're gay!" I just shouted back "I know!" They had no response to that! The look on their faces! 😆 They don't know what to do if someone agrees with them!

Now, I realise that's caused by the speakers, but you know what I mean! 😅
Jul 10, 2018, 10:04 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it's just like tiny little bits of buzz anyway. I don't think it was the speakers anyway, I think it was just the plastic grating in front of the cones vibrating slightly
Jul 10, 2018, 10:04 PM

Am I correct in saying that the meaningless variable which is the length of time that you have existed outwith the womb of your mother has transposed along the dimension of natural numbers by one in the positive direction, resulting in said variable to be equal to twenty?

Well basically my coursemate Gabriel bought a comfy chair 😱 but he lives in Milton Keynes and doesn't have any way to bring it back, he's offering to pay 🤑 if you'd collect it. Unfortunately I don't have space at mine, but he says you're welcome to use it over the summer.

Don't worry if it's too much to ask, I know you're busy :)

George Hughes
You?
May 10, 2018, 10:03 PM
George Hughes
Not bad, just had my second exam
May 10, 2018, 10:03 PM

Connoisseur of shitposts😂😂
May 9, 2018, 8:49 PM
George Hughes
Sure haha
May 9, 2018, 8:48 PM
Callum Davies
I shitpost on there all the time! Look at my nickname once I add you! 😆
May 9, 2018, 8:48 PM
George Hughes
Perfect that is an old meme I made a few years ago
May 9, 2018, 8:47 PM
Callum Davies
Yes, they'll love that
May 9, 2018, 8:47 PM
Callum Davies
You cannot offend these people, trust me

Sure, they'll like that one!
May 9, 2018, 8:46 PM
Callum Davies
Also, why? You should see the shit Elliot posts
May 9, 2018, 8:46 PM
George Hughes
Can I offer my coursework meme?
May 9, 2018, 8:46 PM
Callum Davies
I'm just conferring with the group now. You may have to offer a meme as initiation.
May 9, 2018, 8:46 PM
George Hughes
Considering the drama today haha
May 9, 2018, 8:46 PM
George Hughes
Actually maybe that's a really bad idea
May 9, 2018, 8:45 PM
George Hughes
Oh I'll challenge him to that
May 9, 2018, 8:45 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, no! This is Elliot Johnson's group. The least PC people ever! You'll be right at home, trust me! I doubt you can out-un-PC Elliot! 😆
May 9, 2018, 8:44 PM
George Hughes
Oh god so I can ruin another group?
May 9, 2018, 8:43 PM
Callum Davies
Give us a sec
May 9, 2018, 8:43 PM
Callum Davies
I'll ask the group.
May 9, 2018, 8:43 PM
George Hughes
I think my humour is just too non "pc"
May 9, 2018, 8:43 PM
Callum Davies
There's a group I think you'll fit in perfectly with...
May 9, 2018, 8:43 PM
Callum Davies
Actually...
May 9, 2018, 8:43 PM
Callum Davies
Haha, great.
May 9, 2018, 8:43 PM
George Hughes
I'm off to the winchester then
May 9, 2018, 8:42 PM
Callum Davies
Just let the whole thing blow over
May 9, 2018, 8:42 PM
Callum Davies
No, they don't
May 9, 2018, 8:42 PM
George Hughes
I think I probably did, they must despise me
May 9, 2018, 8:42 PM
Callum Davies
You didn't need to leave
May 9, 2018, 8:41 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, thanks 😊
May 9, 2018, 8:38 PM
George Hughes
It's great that you're learning that already!
May 9, 2018, 8:38 PM
Callum Davies
Because through the journey you realise that you control your sexuality and not the other way around and all that shit! 😆
May 9, 2018, 8:38 PM
Callum Davies
Although apparently it's like the opposite
May 9, 2018, 8:37 PM
Callum Davies
Hahahaha! 😆
May 9, 2018, 8:37 PM
George Hughes
Your desires will be uncontrollable :P (but lets not rehash that)
May 9, 2018, 8:36 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, thanks. 😊 I can already feel some of my actual sex drive come back, and like craving actual human touch rather than just "TITS!!", so who knows where I'll I'll be in a month or two? 😁
May 9, 2018, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
Congrats on being able to accept and move forward with that! Best of luck moving forward :D
May 9, 2018, 8:34 PM
Callum Davies
But if you've not used for months, sounds like that wouldn't be a problem for you. I was nearly every day, and then, tried doing stuff with Katy, and I looked it up, and was like "oh shit". So yeah, I realised I had a problem, decided to change, and I'm doing well, I think. Even though it's been such a short time, I know. And Katy's being so supportive about it! 😅
May 9, 2018, 8:33 PM
George Hughes
Thanks for telling me, I've read about that before and I can see why that would happen
May 9, 2018, 8:31 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then. Because, and I'll be honest, the only reason I know about this is because I've been experiencing it myself, there is such a thing as porn induced ED. And of course, excessive use of that, can lead to desensitisation, thus a lower sex drive for actual people. I only ask because I've been experiencing this as well. I stopped about a week ago, and don't plan to go back. I hope I'm okay telling you this. But if you genuinely believe that you are asexual, then I totally respect that. Good on you man, it's not easy coming out 😅
May 9, 2018, 8:27 PM
George Hughes
I used to watch a little, but not for months at a time usually lmao
May 9, 2018, 8:24 PM
Callum Davies
Okay. Well, and answer this question seriously please, how much porn do you watch?
May 9, 2018, 8:23 PM
George Hughes
But seriously gender doesn't matter, don't support me cause there's nothing to support :P
May 9, 2018, 8:23 PM
George Hughes
Well it really doesn't matter what I am, but I don't feel inclined to actually fuck anyone despite admiring a good body when I see one
May 9, 2018, 8:23 PM
Callum Davies
But if it was a joke, that will have just risen tensions again
May 9, 2018, 8:22 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, I fully support you if that's serious
May 9, 2018, 8:22 PM
Callum Davies
Was that serious?
May 9, 2018, 8:22 PM
Callum Davies
Oh dear
May 9, 2018, 8:21 PM
George Hughes
Oh dear, I'm misogynistic for not liking oral with hair :/
May 9, 2018, 8:07 PM
Callum Davies
I don't wanna say it on the chat for fear of "triggering" them again, but okay if they don't agree with your opinion. I might not, necessarily. But it feels like they're not allowing you to have that opinion
May 9, 2018, 8:05 PM
George Hughes
I never heard you say that :P
May 9, 2018, 7:51 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, just saw the chat
May 9, 2018, 7:51 PM
Callum Davies
It is almost like people with a slightly different opinion is totally unacceptable to them. And I'd say Elliot should be okay to talk to. Why, has he messaged you?
May 9, 2018, 7:50 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, kinda. Just between you and I. Sometimes they do strike me as the archetypal Tumblr tot! 😅
May 9, 2018, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
But should I stay quiet?
May 9, 2018, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
I want to respond to Elliot..
May 9, 2018, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
No offense of course
May 9, 2018, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
I hate to say it but isn't that a little immature of them? :/
May 9, 2018, 7:47 PM
Callum Davies
In my experience with Jasper, that's sometimes the best thing. And don't worry, Jasper's sometimes a bit sensitive. I sometimes say something and they take offense to it, and I'm like sorry, and then in 2 hours time, they're saying sorry for overeating, and we're fine again. I'd just give them some space
May 9, 2018, 7:45 PM
George Hughes
Again, I'm sorry
May 9, 2018, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
I'll do that too then
May 9, 2018, 7:43 PM
Callum Davies
That's what I'm gonna do
May 9, 2018, 7:43 PM
Callum Davies
I wouldn't leave, rather just not message on there for a little while
May 9, 2018, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
You definitely have.
Maybe I should just leave the chat, but I feel like that's walking away from the problem
May 9, 2018, 7:41 PM
Callum Davies
?
May 9, 2018, 7:41 PM
Callum Davies
Have I? I feel like I have, but they're not seeming to get it. And I feel like you've explained very clearly as well. I think we maybe need to wait for the dust to settle!
May 9, 2018, 7:40 PM
George Hughes
Well you've explained yourself very clearly
May 9, 2018, 7:40 PM
Callum Davies
And I'm not blameless
May 9, 2018, 7:40 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, yeah. But we all make mistakes. I do think they're being kinda unfair here, not even giving us a chance to explain
May 9, 2018, 7:39 PM
George Hughes
This one is on me.. although I still don't understand what I've done.
I'm sorry for not thinking about who was in the chat when I made that joke and causing this conflict. :(
May 9, 2018, 7:38 PM
Callum Davies
I understand we may have messed up, but Jesus Christ, can they not give us a chance to be heard out! Why the witch hunt?
May 9, 2018, 7:38 PM
Callum Davies
Jesus Christ, I give up
May 9, 2018, 7:37 PM
George Hughes
I suppose
May 9, 2018, 7:30 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yeah, discuss it definitely. I just think making jokes during the discussion might not be the best idea for now
May 9, 2018, 7:29 PM
George Hughes
I hope
May 9, 2018, 7:29 PM
George Hughes
I guess, but I want to discuss it so that I can see their problem :/ maybe I'm wrong but I didn't hurt anyone
May 9, 2018, 7:28 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno, I'm feeling a bit out of my depth here. But you should maybe stop being so jovial, just for a few messages. Maybe a sincere apology is in order?
May 9, 2018, 7:27 PM
George Hughes
Fak have I messed up? I'm sorry if this causes conflict
May 9, 2018, 7:26 PM
Callum Davies
Will do, cheers 😊

If you want to see where they got their idea, watch this ;)
May 8, 2018, 9:06 PM
George Hughes
And anyway I overestimated their event management capabilities
May 8, 2018, 9:06 PM
George Hughes
Sometimes a scapegoat is useful ;)
May 8, 2018, 9:05 PM
Callum Davies
It would be very unreasonable of me to blame you! 😆
May 8, 2018, 9:04 PM
Callum Davies
Aww, don't worry about it. It's not your fault
May 8, 2018, 9:04 PM
George Hughes
Sozz :(
May 8, 2018, 8:54 PM
Callum Davies
Aww, NOOOOO. That's a shame. But I'll let Katy know
May 8, 2018, 8:52 PM
George Hughes
Cancellé
May 8, 2018, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
It's off haha
May 8, 2018, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
I'll let you know :) Have a good drive! haha
May 8, 2018, 8:32 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then, I'll leave you to discuss. I'll be back online in like half an hour; currently using data and needing to drive home! 😅
May 8, 2018, 8:31 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck, surely they had a deal with the charities?
May 8, 2018, 8:30 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it's a bit of a bugger. How's the charity taking it!? 😱
May 8, 2018, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
I'm discussing it now
May 8, 2018, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
So meh
May 8, 2018, 8:30 PM
George Hughes
But advertising and promotion are probably the most important parts of event management and they've made a hash of that :P
May 8, 2018, 8:29 PM
George Hughes
Most likely I won't hahah
May 8, 2018, 8:29 PM
Callum Davies
Aww, but how's that affecting you? Like, are you sure you'll still be able to play on this new date?
May 8, 2018, 8:28 PM
George Hughes
No idea when til tho
May 8, 2018, 8:27 PM
George Hughes
If I were you, I'd just change your plans, with the mess its been so far, I bet it'll end up getting held back
May 8, 2018, 8:27 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, I do really want to do this casino thing, but if it's not on, well then, let's not let down this person 😅
May 8, 2018, 8:26 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, is that for sure. Because Katy's friend was wanting to have a Eurovision and hang out party on the 12th, but we couldn't go because of that. So should I tell Katy that it might be a good idea to tell them the change of plans?
May 8, 2018, 8:26 PM
George Hughes
They might be postponing :|
May 8, 2018, 8:23 PM
Callum Davies
Well they've got two tickets sold! So provide them! 😆 It's not your fault, I know. But it's a shame if we can't go, because we both really want to and looking forward to it 😅
May 8, 2018, 8:22 PM
George Hughes
They just replied, um they're struggling with ticket sales hahaha surprise surprise
May 8, 2018, 7:52 PM
George Hughes
Sorry haha
May 8, 2018, 7:51 PM
George Hughes
Hell I don't even know if any tickets have been printed off at all
May 8, 2018, 7:50 PM
George Hughes
The organiser of party box who is running the casino night on saturday never gave your tickets to Ben, but I've messaged asking if it's possible to pay at the door.. I don't blame you if you can't come though, the whole thing is horribly disorganised and I don't think whoever is in charge should be in charge at all
May 8, 2018, 7:50 PM
George Hughes
Thankoo

May 2, 2018, 8:59 PM

Nah, that's fine. I should probably leave you to study! 😅
May 2, 2018, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
Doing ze studies, but can chat on the back burner ;)
May 2, 2018, 8:34 PM

Oh shit it's a real piano, surely that must be bad for it, I've gotta hear this 😂😂
May 2, 2018, 3:30 PM
Callum Davies
Really? That's awesome! But like, I'm amazed that the piano didn't actually break during that. Like, I'm pretty sure the strings weren't meant to withstand that much of a (if you'll pardon the pun) hammering!
May 2, 2018, 3:29 PM

Black Midi is a genre of its own 😂

It was like a classical piece of music, but instead of usual musical instructions like "to coda" or something like that, it had instructions like "enter cow"

Hmm, recommendations? Not really, I don't use an awful lot of apps, I'm pretty boring like that. The way I see it, my PS3 is for games, the phone's for communication! 😅 The Facebook messenger app is fine, but I've found (on Android at least, I'm not sure how it is for Apple) that the actual Facebook app itself has caching issues, so it just keeps getting bigger and bigger unless you actually clear the cache periodically yourself

Apr 13, 2018, 6:41 PM
Callum Davies
Should have asked mum to leave at 6:00, then I might have stood a chance at us leaving for 6:30! 😆
Apr 13, 2018, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies
Hi, didn't account for mum's margin for error. We'll most likely be leaving more like 6:45 at this rate
Apr 13, 2018, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 11, 2018, 4:15 PM

My parents might not be able to pick us up in the evening
Apr 11, 2018, 4:12 PM

George Hughes
And you can crash at ours?
Apr 10, 2018, 11:34 PM
George Hughes
I might be in town already for a rehearsal so I'd either meet you in town or if I'm home, just drive to mine and we'll get a bus in?
Apr 10, 2018, 11:34 PM
Callum Davies
That'd be awesome, cheers! What time and how would we get there then?
Apr 10, 2018, 11:32 PM
George Hughes
I can see if my parents would pick us up at 11ish if you want so you can have a drink?
Apr 10, 2018, 11:31 PM
George Hughes
Awesome 😁 that'll be fun!
Apr 10, 2018, 11:31 PM

Yeah, that's true. He can get very dark sometimes. But I love his "real" series. I'll see if I can find a link to the playlist
Apr 10, 2018, 11:15 PM
George Hughes
I do love dry humour 😎 Although sometimes it gets a little depressive :p
Apr 10, 2018, 11:12 PM
Callum Davies
Which I like! 😁
Apr 10, 2018, 11:10 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I've been really getting into him recently; he's very dry humoured
Apr 10, 2018, 11:10 PM
George Hughes
But
Apr 10, 2018, 10:28 PM
George Hughes
Nut rather
Apr 10, 2018, 10:28 PM

Not gonna lie I haven't watched much of his stuff recently, nut that does sound like something he would do 😂
Apr 10, 2018, 10:28 PM

Sorry. "This is the greatest X of All Time"
Apr 10, 2018, 9:05 PM
Callum Davies
Did you ever notice that pretty much all of penguinz0's video descriptions are "The greatest X of All Time"? 😂
Apr 10, 2018, 9:04 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome thanks 😎
Apr 10, 2018, 1:17 PM

Awesome :) also the tickets are still not on sale yet but they should be soon
Apr 10, 2018, 1:17 PM
Callum Davies
Hmm, lemmie think about it. Not sure what I'll be feeling like by then, but it sounds fun. Most probably! 😁
Apr 10, 2018, 10:52 AM

Do you fancy the Green Room again on Friday? My friend is playing, the music will be classic psych rock :p
Apr 10, 2018, 12:09 AM

Season 4 is looking gooood
Apr 6, 2018, 11:19 PM
George Hughes
10/10 walking animation
Apr 6, 2018, 11:19 PM
George Hughes
That makes me think of the Big Lez Show 😂
Apr 6, 2018, 11:19 PM
Callum Davies
It's a really different animation style and I think it's done by a different guy, but I think that's the point of the April fools episode
Apr 6, 2018, 10:26 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah
Apr 6, 2018, 10:22 PM
George Hughes
I thought so, bushworld referring to Australia?😆
Apr 6, 2018, 10:20 PM
Callum Davies
No probs. That's the April fools episode, by the way

Not too sure. Probably not that long after midnight. Like, probably between 11 and 1 maybe? I'll be honest, I didn't really have a plan 😅
Apr 5, 2018, 6:37 PM
George Hughes
How late will you be staying out?
Apr 5, 2018, 6:36 PM
George Hughes
Cool, I'll need to grab myself something to eat soon but that should be class
Apr 5, 2018, 6:36 PM
Callum Davies
Probably earlier. Probably getting home about 7 though. So, gimmie time to wind down, ear dinner and stuff, my best guess would be somewhere between 7:30 and 8:00ish
Apr 5, 2018, 6:33 PM
Callum Davies
Dunno man, but am just leaving Inver now. Like, maybe 8/8:30?
Apr 5, 2018, 6:25 PM

AHH, well, Zoe's doing something tomorrow afternoon, in scone I think she said. So I could meet you tomorrow afternoon
Apr 3, 2018, 6:14 PM
George Hughes
But if we play til 3-4ish, I could meet you afterwards and we could go for a drink or something?
Apr 3, 2018, 6:13 PM
George Hughes
Turns out I'm now free tomorrow as well, but you're meeting Zo aren't you?
Think me and Ben are going to busk on Thursday cause it's the first good day this week
Apr 3, 2018, 6:13 PM
Callum Davies
Hi man, just to let you know that Thursday is free for me then. If you wanna meet up and hang out 😉
Apr 3, 2018, 10:38 AM
George Hughes
That's awesome 😆 she's always cool 😎
Apr 2, 2018, 8:54 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, not too sure. Katy just messaged me this morning saying "do you have a national trust card?" 😂 And no worries about Wednesday; I've taken the opportunity to finally arrange that coffee with Zoë. I'm just sorry it took so long! 😬 But she's hella cool about it, as always 😉
Apr 2, 2018, 7:09 PM
George Hughes
A castle? Sounds cool :D
Apr 2, 2018, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Might be going to a castle on Thursday. I dunno, I'll see. But I'll let you know about Thursday 😉
Apr 2, 2018, 6:59 PM
George Hughes
I'm going to a music thing on Wednesday with Ben, but I'm free Thursday? :P
Apr 2, 2018, 6:57 PM

Hmm, I may have a busy morning, and I've got adventure Circus in the evening, but Wednesday's looking good? 😁
Apr 2, 2018, 6:57 PM

Ha ha, fair enough. Was just taking an interest 💁🏻 Let me know how the ticket sales go once they go "online"; as it were
Apr 2, 2018, 6:54 PM
George Hughes
But I imagine they're waiting to gather interest
Apr 2, 2018, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
I don't believe they're on sale yet haha, either that or no one has told me and there's no promotion lol
Apr 2, 2018, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
Oops I appear to have slept all day :/
Apr 2, 2018, 6:52 PM

Apr 2, 2018, 12:02 PM

I've found this charming series by James May called the Reassembler where he puts various pieces of machinery back together and chats about it for half an hour
Apr 2, 2018, 12:00 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, so I've heard
Apr 2, 2018, 11:58 AM

No, spend the money on cocaine and prostitutes instead of a lambo! 😆
Mar 27, 2018, 4:50 PM

That's exactly why you should 😎
Mar 27, 2018, 4:47 PM

Video and audio feeds, yes. Lights are worked on independently
Mar 26, 2018, 6:20 PM

Sing harmonies with yourself. All at once. 😆

Mar 22, 2018, 12:46 PM

He studies music there
Mar 22, 2018, 12:45 PM
Callum Davies
He was at the college?
Mar 22, 2018, 12:45 PM
George Hughes
Great 😂 Do you see him at college?
Mar 22, 2018, 12:44 PM
Callum Davies
He likes Ben Folds and the Jackson 5, he knows all the words to 'Stayin' Alive'! 😁
Mar 22, 2018, 12:42 PM
George Hughes
He is, he's so quiet, but he gets piano gigs at the Green Room, I need to go see him sometime
Mar 22, 2018, 12:41 PM
Callum Davies
So I hear! And so modest as well! 😆
Mar 22, 2018, 12:40 PM
George Hughes
And their drummer is class!
Mar 22, 2018, 12:40 PM
George Hughes
Their keyboard player George is incredible, he's definitely going places
Mar 22, 2018, 12:40 PM
Callum Davies
😆 that's marvelous!
Mar 22, 2018, 12:39 PM
George Hughes
They're still singing that, kind of ironic
Mar 22, 2018, 12:38 PM
George Hughes
Nah they're still going as far as I know, although remember that song we used to sing? "You ain't going nowhere"
Mar 22, 2018, 12:38 PM
Callum Davies
I thought they disbanded after you left
Mar 22, 2018, 12:37 PM

Well
Mar 22, 2018, 12:37 PM

I wouldn't listen to the music though, the band are shite
Mar 22, 2018, 12:33 PM

Yeah, I've seen that 😁
Mar 22, 2018, 12:32 PM
George Hughes
Exactly :D There's a list of the charities you'll be supporting (should you lose) on the poster I shared ;)
Mar 22, 2018, 12:32 PM
Callum Davies
Nice! And it's for charity, right? So if I do lose some money, it's going to a good cause 💁🏻
Mar 22, 2018, 12:30 PM
George Hughes
See the company that's hosting it, they're planning on using us as a house band, so I'm really excited! It'll mean lots of weddings and big events for us to play at 😁😁
Mar 22, 2018, 12:29 PM
Callum Davies
Of course 💁🏻
Mar 22, 2018, 12:28 PM

I believe so, of course set yourself a limit ;)
Mar 22, 2018, 12:28 PM

And I'm assuming it's £10 for entry, and then however much you want to convert into chips?

Mar 22, 2018, 12:22 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, alrighty then. If you give me your account number and sort code I'll wire the money into your account. I think Katy's coming, so could you see about maybe getting two tickets? I'll need to double check with her, though. Can I have an answer to you by tonight?
Mar 22, 2018, 12:21 PM
George Hughes
I think we'll be in suits, so I guess wear your usual casino attire 💁🏼‍♂️💸
Mar 22, 2018, 12:16 PM

Okay then, I was just thinking because it's a casino night! 😆

Mar 22, 2018, 12:12 PM

Looks fun. Is there a dress code?
Mar 22, 2018, 12:04 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that'd be great, cheers 😉

Btw are you wanting tickets for the charity night? :P
Mar 22, 2018, 11:59 AM

Yah yah I gotcha 😆
Mar 22, 2018, 9:21 AM

Well, it's not actually covered. It's covered by tshirt, if you see what I mean!😅
Mar 22, 2018, 9:19 AM
George Hughes
Siiick. You'll be goood
Mar 22, 2018, 9:11 AM

It is covered, and wearing a clean hoodie and t-shirt
Mar 22, 2018, 9:10 AM
George Hughes
Keep it covered as well, don't want it getting infected
Mar 22, 2018, 9:09 AM
George Hughes
Make sure you're wearing clothes that won't rub at all
Mar 22, 2018, 9:09 AM
Callum Davies
Okay, that's cool. But I've taken the wrap off for college! 😬 I'll rewrap it when I get home 😁
Mar 22, 2018, 9:09 AM
George Hughes
Maybe it was only for the rest of the day
Mar 22, 2018, 9:08 AM
George Hughes
Redress it obviously
Mar 22, 2018, 9:08 AM
George Hughes
I'm trying to remember, I know I was annoyed because it meant shouldn't have showers for a day or so
Mar 22, 2018, 9:07 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, and really, 48 hours?
Mar 22, 2018, 9:06 AM
George Hughes
Did the guy tell you what moisturizer to use?
Mar 22, 2018, 9:00 AM
George Hughes
Try keep it out of water during that time as well
Mar 22, 2018, 8:59 AM
George Hughes
Well I don't exactly remember but you'll want to keep it wrapped for the first 48 hours i think
Mar 22, 2018, 8:59 AM
Callum Davies
Yo George, can I ask question about tattoo? How long do you keep it wrapped for, and when do you wrap it? Just asking because yours still looks so great! 😁
Mar 22, 2018, 8:52 AM
George Hughes
Sweet! It looks so cool, and especially because it's shiny and new 😆
Mar 22, 2018, 7:36 AM

Cool, was curious to hear it from someone who's probably a bit more "liberal" than me 💁🏼‍♂️
Mar 21, 2018, 8:25 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that's kinda my stance on it too 💁🏻
Mar 21, 2018, 8:20 PM
George Hughes
And yeah, although it's all taken out of context so it's hard to even see the joke. It was a bad joke tbf, but it's not harmful
Mar 21, 2018, 8:18 PM
George Hughes
That looks awesome! 😁 I bet you're chuffed!
Mar 21, 2018, 8:17 PM

Just looked it up. Not too sure. I mean, it wasn't a very funny thing to do in my opinion, but it was maybe a little far to rule it a hate crime

Exactly. You were playing a serialistic version of all star 💁🏻
Mar 20, 2018, 12:43 PM

Well the whole purpose of serialism is to be chromatic and arrhythmic 😂
Mar 20, 2018, 12:37 PM

Or rather, you did
Mar 20, 2018, 12:36 PM

So am I. I just called it serialism! 😆
Mar 20, 2018, 12:36 PM

Yeah that's totally it actually, and not at all because I'm terrible at piano, all for the memes
Mar 20, 2018, 12:35 PM

Wasn't that the point? It's purposefully bad, because memes
Mar 20, 2018, 12:34 PM

Callum Davies
I'll just walk man, it's cool
Mar 14, 2018, 8:31 PM
George Hughes
Well whatever you'd rather do 😆
Mar 14, 2018, 8:25 PM

Mar 14, 2018, 8:25 PM
Callum Davies
That's cool. Cheers. But hey, it really is walkable! 😅
Mar 14, 2018, 8:25 PM
George Hughes
I'll check for you shortly and let you know :)
Mar 14, 2018, 8:24 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, flipping council! 😆 That's fine, I'll just walk then. It's well within walking distance
Mar 14, 2018, 8:23 PM
George Hughes
9:15 sounds good
Mar 14, 2018, 8:23 PM
George Hughes
I can check for you
Mar 14, 2018, 8:23 PM
George Hughes
There are places to park, but there's a crane blocking the entrance at the moment I think 🤔
Mar 14, 2018, 8:22 PM
Callum Davies
Hey man, I'll leave the hotel at like 9, be at yours at like 9:15 maybe? Wait, is there anywhere to park at your place, or should I keep my car parked where it is?
Mar 14, 2018, 8:09 PM

Hi man, how you doing? Are you ready for that call?
Mar 13, 2018, 8:54 PM

Cheers 😉

Mar 13, 2018, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies
Hey man, would I be able to call you at about 9 tonight about meeting up with you in Edinburgh tomorrow?
Mar 13, 2018, 6:03 PM
George Hughes
Nah it's cool, and yeah that'll be awesome, only if it suits you tho
Mar 11, 2018, 1:50 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that's me back now, thanks. Yeah, you too. Sorry I had to dart off so quickly. As I say, I'll see what I can do about coming round on Wednesday evening
Mar 11, 2018, 1:40 AM
George Hughes
Thanks for coming tonight, was great to see you
Mar 11, 2018, 1:40 AM

Mar 10, 2018, 7:57 PM

I reckon "Die, or don't" would be a good song title! 😆

It's a great place for socialising! 😁Mind the guy we met playing pool in brig? He was kicking about last time I played there, said I was much better at guitar than pool 😂
Mar 8, 2018, 9:55 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, that's fine. And we're not attached at the hip! Besides, I'll have great company. I'll socialize! I can do that now since the break up, for some reason! 😂
Mar 8, 2018, 9:48 PM
George Hughes
Aw well, hope you won't be too lonely 😉 soz for not replying sooner. Coursework lol
Mar 8, 2018, 9:33 PM

So Katy might not be able to make it to the venue on Saturday. 💁🏻
Mar 8, 2018, 7:27 PM
Callum Davies
Will do 😉
Mar 8, 2018, 5:22 PM
George Hughes
Say hi for me! See ya soon 😁

Anyway, a wild Kyle has appeared so I'll be saying goodbye for now. See you at the weekend
Mar 8, 2018, 4:51 PM
George Hughes
Oooh a joker and a jokee 🤔😝
Mar 8, 2018, 4:50 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, well I couldn't stop you. But I trust you. And she'd probably just laugh. She's really cool; she can take a joke 😉
Mar 8, 2018, 4:49 PM
George Hughes
Enquire
Mar 8, 2018, 4:48 PM
George Hughes
I'll be sure to enquiry awkwardly about your "relationship" as much as possible 😇
Mar 8, 2018, 4:48 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome! I can't really remember exactly how much I've told you about Katy, but just wanna say that me and her aren't exactly a thing at the moment. Not like in a "Her!? God no!" Kinda way, just to avoid a potentially awkward moment. But who knows what'll happen? 💁🏻
Mar 8, 2018, 4:47 PM
George Hughes
maybe 9
Mar 8, 2018, 4:45 PM
George Hughes
We start at half 9 I think
Mar 8, 2018, 4:45 PM
George Hughes
Yeah sure, the more the merrier!
Mar 8, 2018, 4:45 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, awesome! 😄 Is it okay if I invite Katy, if she's not working? Also, what time are you playing?
Mar 8, 2018, 4:44 PM
George Hughes
That's awesome :D We've invited a couple other folk to play so while they're doing their thing, we can catch up :)
Mar 8, 2018, 4:43 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, the venue is owned by green room, maybe that was my mix up! I'll be in venue, then! 😆
Mar 8, 2018, 4:42 PM
George Hughes
Hahah I meant the Venue
Mar 8, 2018, 4:41 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah
Mar 8, 2018, 4:41 PM
George Hughes
I am, did I say the green room?
Mar 8, 2018, 4:41 PM
Callum Davies
I thought you were playing?
Mar 8, 2018, 4:41 PM
George Hughes
Well you won't see me there ;)
Mar 8, 2018, 4:40 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, by the way, I'll be making it to green room on Saturday! 😁
Mar 8, 2018, 4:40 PM

Hey bro :D

Mar 5, 2018, 9:02 PM

Hey bro, how did you get on with your college work? :P
Mar 5, 2018, 8:15 PM
George Hughes
Thank you 😊
Mar 3, 2018, 6:35 PM
Callum Davies
Thanks. I hope your evening goes well too 😊
Mar 3, 2018, 6:35 PM
George Hughes
Good plan, have a productive evening
Mar 3, 2018, 6:34 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, well, back to work
Mar 3, 2018, 6:34 PM
George Hughes
It's bad, but at least you won't be working into the day
Mar 3, 2018, 6:34 PM
George Hughes
Okay well that's not awful 😆
Mar 3, 2018, 6:34 PM
Callum Davies
Am, that is
Mar 3, 2018, 6:33 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, yeah. I'll probably get it done by like, maybe 4/5 tomorrow? 😂
Mar 3, 2018, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Well fuck 😂 time is a bitch sometimes
Mar 3, 2018, 6:33 PM
Callum Davies
No, I think I'm going to need to work all of tonight and tomorrow to do it! 😂
Mar 3, 2018, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
Don't push yourself too hard, if you think you can manage it tomorrow, get some sleep and finish it then
Mar 3, 2018, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
No, when I say working into tomorrow, I mean I will still be working when tomorrow comes. I will be working all hours of the night. I will not sleep tonight
Mar 3, 2018, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
Well at least you've started it, tomorrow won't be so stressful
Mar 3, 2018, 6:30 PM
Callum Davies
Still doing it mate. Probably gonna be working into tomorrow
Mar 3, 2018, 6:29 PM
George Hughes
Did you manage to get a lot of work done?
Mar 3, 2018, 6:29 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it's crazy! 😂
Mar 3, 2018, 6:28 PM
George Hughes
Your name though? 😂
Mar 3, 2018, 6:27 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha ours did that last year as well, all the links I put for references were flagged 😂
Mar 3, 2018, 6:27 PM
Callum Davies
The plagiarism AI the college uses pulled me up for the url in my reference, which, you know, was used as a reference, I was literally saying myself that it wasn't my own words! and also pulled me up on the fact I quoted my name and student number on the document, because I wrote it!
Mar 3, 2018, 5:04 PM
George Hughes
They certainly do check things carefully, they pulled me up for plagiarism because they made a connection between a few things in my work, which was mildly infuriating because they just coincidences 🙄😂
Mar 3, 2018, 5:01 PM
George Hughes
Yeah 😆
Mar 3, 2018, 5:00 PM
Callum Davies
Aww, well. I mean, I wasn't genuinely suggesting that you use that: I feel like that would be pretty easy to spot! XD
Mar 3, 2018, 4:59 PM
George Hughes
And the lecturer has provided images to decrypt
Mar 3, 2018, 4:57 PM
George Hughes
If you're thinking for the program, unfortunately I need to write it in C and make it use ppm images

Mar 3, 2018, 4:54 PM

Ooh! I may have a cheat for you on one of those...
Mar 3, 2018, 4:53 PM
George Hughes
Replace the first bit of your paragraph with "I've still got to draw 8 graphs, write about them and write a program which encrypts and decrypts information into images" and there's your answer 💁🏼‍♂️
Mar 3, 2018, 4:53 PM
Callum Davies
Oh! 😆 A genuine horror I'm still having to face! I've got to write up 20 questions now. How about what's the point? Why am I still here? Won't somebody please kill me? 😂

How's your work going?
Mar 3, 2018, 4:51 PM
George Hughes
It was genuine horror 😂
Mar 3, 2018, 4:49 PM
Callum Davies
I can't tell if that's sarcasm or not! 😅
Mar 3, 2018, 2:46 PM

Sooooo much paper
Mar 3, 2018, 2:44 PM

So much paper 🙄🙄
Mar 3, 2018, 2:44 PM

Dossier??
Mar 3, 2018, 2:35 PM
Callum Davies
I've set up a sort of inbox and outbox system for reading through the various parts of the "dossier" I guess you could call it! 😂
Mar 3, 2018, 2:24 PM
George Hughes
Same 🙄 how are you getting on?
Mar 3, 2018, 2:16 PM
Callum Davies
This fucking work! 😖
Mar 3, 2018, 2:15 PM

Mar 2, 2018, 7:02 PM

I shall aim to have all my coursework done for then so I can relax and tune in and tune out
Mar 2, 2018, 7:01 PM

Niceee!! Aw man I'm buzzed! So who wrote it?
Mar 2, 2018, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah! I checked. It's legit. Radio 4. The home of hitchhiker's. It's always been on radio 4 lol. On Thursday. Don't know the exact time I'm afraid
Mar 2, 2018, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
I must tune in
Mar 2, 2018, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
What side will it be on?
Mar 2, 2018, 6:48 PM

Seriously?? Now that is exciting!! 😮😮
Mar 2, 2018, 6:48 PM
Callum Davies
*Sixth season
Mar 2, 2018, 6:43 PM

Oh, by the way...

THERE'S GONNA BE A SIXTHS OF THE HITCHHIKER'S RADIO PLAY!!!!😆
Mar 2, 2018, 6:43 PM

Ha ha, your choice, ma man 😉
Mar 2, 2018, 6:39 PM

It'd be kinder to eat healthy ;)
Mar 2, 2018, 6:35 PM

Yeah, be kind to yourself!
Mar 2, 2018, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Well I could walk to Tesco but nahhh
Mar 2, 2018, 6:31 PM

You're allowed a few cheat days. Plus, if that's all you've got, you don't really have any other options, do you? 😅
Mar 2, 2018, 6:26 PM
George Hughes
I may just do that
Mar 2, 2018, 6:24 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow that is some gif 😂
Mar 2, 2018, 6:24 PM

Mar 2, 2018, 5:35 PM

Just trying to motivate you for your next workout 😉
Mar 2, 2018, 5:23 PM
Callum Davies
I misread that at first. I thought it said flaunt that dad bod! I was like "excuse me!? Bitch please!" 😆
Mar 2, 2018, 5:09 PM
George Hughes
Aww yeee flaunt dat bod boi, shake it
Mar 2, 2018, 5:06 PM

Well, I wasn't. But now that you've given me the idea...
Mar 2, 2018, 5:06 PM

Mar 2, 2018, 3:56 PM
George Hughes
Always nice to have time left at the end
Mar 2, 2018, 3:56 PM
George Hughes
Make sure you do 🤔
Mar 2, 2018, 3:56 PM
Callum Davies
Okay. I'll start it tomorrow then. I promise. To myself. Get up, shower, shave, all that shit. Then actually sit down at my desk and actually do some fucking work! 😬
Mar 2, 2018, 3:56 PM
George Hughes
I would give yourself 2 days for that, the research part will kill you before you get to the questions otherwise
Mar 2, 2018, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno. We were given like 3 weeks, but I reckon it can be bashed out in a day. It's like a research task, at the end of which we need to pose a report of 20 questions/problems to a hypothetical venue manager, as well as offering possible solutions to those problems
Mar 2, 2018, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
How much do you have to do for it?
Mar 2, 2018, 3:49 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, that's cool. My thing is still for Monday. Because it's online submission 😓
Mar 2, 2018, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
Thank goodness
Mar 2, 2018, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
It was due on Monday but it got pushed back
Mar 2, 2018, 3:48 PM
Callum Davies
Is this your thing due on Monday as well? 😁
Mar 2, 2018, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
Exactly the same here 🙄
Mar 2, 2018, 3:47 PM
Callum Davies
I should be doing work. But I really can't be arsed/don't want to! 😅
Mar 2, 2018, 3:45 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 2, 2018, 2:58 PM
George Hughes
Quite probably in this weather 😂
Mar 2, 2018, 2:57 PM
Callum Davies
A yeti? 😆
Mar 2, 2018, 2:57 PM
George Hughes
You'd look like you're running from something
Mar 2, 2018, 2:55 PM
George Hughes
Great idea 😂
Mar 2, 2018, 2:55 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, running in a big fur parka! 😆
Mar 2, 2018, 2:52 PM
George Hughes
But I've been waiting for it to get warmer
Mar 2, 2018, 2:50 PM
George Hughes
Same, I live right next to the canal which is perfect for running along
Mar 2, 2018, 2:50 PM
Callum Davies
Haha yeah, I'm thinking of starting up running once the snow's over
Mar 2, 2018, 2:49 PM
George Hughes
Haha same, I would say go for a run but it's a little slippy
Mar 2, 2018, 2:48 PM
Callum Davies
Bodyweight exercises. I really need to do more cardio! 😅
Mar 2, 2018, 2:47 PM
George Hughes
That's great, did you do cardio or weights?
Mar 2, 2018, 2:47 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, I've just had a great workout, so I feel amazing right now! 😄
Mar 2, 2018, 1:56 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I wouldn't! The veggie dies in your household, apparently! 😆
😆George Hughes
Mar 2, 2018, 1:54 PM
George Hughes
But whatever I got sausage rolls so I'll survive this cold winter
Mar 2, 2018, 1:41 PM
Callum Davies
Aww 😔
Mar 2, 2018, 1:39 PM
George Hughes
All I wanted was a bacon sandwich 😢
Mar 2, 2018, 1:39 PM
Callum Davies
Perfect! 😆
Mar 2, 2018, 1:38 PM
George Hughes
Welp there's no bread in the shops, but there were knives 😇
Mar 2, 2018, 1:38 PM
George Hughes
😋
Mar 2, 2018, 1:08 PM
George Hughes
What a lovely noise
Mar 2, 2018, 1:08 PM
Callum Davies
That one
Mar 2, 2018, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 2, 2018, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies
The noise Hannibal makes with his lips?
Mar 2, 2018, 1:06 PM

What does that sound like?😂
Mar 2, 2018, 1:06 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
Mar 2, 2018, 1:06 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 2, 2018, 1:05 PM
George Hughes
But there will be no bread getting sliced 😏
Mar 2, 2018, 1:05 PM
George Hughes
That is a plan and a half 🤔 I guess you could say it's the best idea since sliced bread 💁‍♂️
Mar 2, 2018, 1:04 PM
Callum Davies
To buy bread, and a knife. But not a bread knife...😈
Mar 2, 2018, 12:55 PM
George Hughes
Fml
Mar 2, 2018, 12:46 PM
George Hughes
Now I need to walk in the snow
Mar 2, 2018, 12:46 PM
George Hughes
I will destroy
Mar 2, 2018, 12:46 PM
George Hughes
Yup
Mar 2, 2018, 12:46 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 2, 2018, 12:45 PM

Much anger
Mar 2, 2018, 12:45 PM

Someone ate my bread 😢

Mar 2, 2018, 10:43 AM

It will be glorious! I shall name it... Satan 2.. oh wait, google says that name is already taken 🤔
Mar 2, 2018, 10:41 AM
Callum Davies
Then create the demonic snowman, I command thee! 🔥😈
Mar 2, 2018, 10:40 AM
George Hughes
That's certainly very affordable 🔥
Mar 2, 2018, 10:38 AM
Callum Davies
What about the cost of a hose extension, a saw and a roll of duct tape? 😆
Mar 2, 2018, 10:37 AM
George Hughes
Luckily it's bills inclusive ;)
Mar 2, 2018, 10:34 AM
Callum Davies
It'd put your gas bill up, I reckon! 😆
Mar 2, 2018, 10:25 AM
George Hughes
Hahah I want that built outside my accommodation 😂😂
Mar 2, 2018, 10:24 AM
Callum Davies
Building this? 😂

Mar 2, 2018, 10:20 AM
George Hughes
You'll be snowed in again I guess?
Mar 2, 2018, 10:18 AM
George Hughes
You got plans today?
Mar 2, 2018, 10:18 AM
Callum Davies
This is true! 😆
Mar 2, 2018, 10:12 AM
George Hughes
Hahah although it would lead to an extended winter 😢
Mar 2, 2018, 10:12 AM
Callum Davies
He should send it our way; it might melt the snow! 😆
Mar 2, 2018, 10:11 AM
George Hughes
He uh made an "invincible" nuclear missile, hooray
Mar 2, 2018, 10:09 AM
Callum Davies
Ohh! 😂
Mar 2, 2018, 10:09 AM
George Hughes
Putin lmao
Mar 2, 2018, 10:09 AM
Callum Davies
What!? 😂
Mar 2, 2018, 10:09 AM

Obviously 😆 but it's also Luton's fault for building Satan 2
Mar 2, 2018, 10:08 AM
Callum Davies
It's all trump's fault 😆
Mar 2, 2018, 10:07 AM
George Hughes
Day 3 of the apocalypse!
Mar 2, 2018, 10:07 AM
Callum Davies
What's this? Day 3 of snow? 😕
Mar 2, 2018, 10:06 AM
George Hughes
I'm also pretty tired, might do the same soon. Thank you for the chat 😁
Chat later! Night
Mar 1, 2018, 10:40 PM
Callum Davies
Hmm, I may actually go to bed soon. Pretty tired. 😕 Thank for meme chat, was fun. Speak soon 😉
Mar 1, 2018, 10:39 PM
George Hughes
Good man, it's a good mindset to take 😄
Mar 1, 2018, 10:36 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. If I'm presented with a compelling enough argument, my mind can be changed. I'm actually pretty open minded nowadays 😁
Mar 1, 2018, 10:35 PM
George Hughes
Hah I just made you admit it's a funny meme 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 10:33 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I guess it is 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 10:31 PM
George Hughes
Also the fact that it annoys so many people is actually pretty funny 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 10:28 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck. I guess you're right. Damn! 😅
Mar 1, 2018, 10:28 PM
George Hughes
I mean if it makes you angry, it's done it's job 💁‍♂️
Mar 1, 2018, 10:26 PM
Callum Davies
Just go anger people? Well then, its creator is a sadist then! 😠
Mar 1, 2018, 10:21 PM
George Hughes
That's pretty much the point of it I guess 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 10:16 PM
Callum Davies
It's just so, unnecessary. The meme makes no sense, it has no purpose. Which would be fine if it were a surreal meme, but no! It's trying to be a normie meme. It's just....😓
Mar 1, 2018, 10:14 PM
George Hughes
Sadness indeed
Mar 1, 2018, 10:12 PM
Callum Davies
😭
Mar 1, 2018, 10:11 PM
George Hughes
Unfortunately is does, for no reason 💁‍♂️
Mar 1, 2018, 10:11 PM
Callum Davies
It does not exist
Mar 1, 2018, 10:11 PM
Callum Davies
We do not talk of that shit!
Mar 1, 2018, 10:11 PM
Callum Davies
NO! 😡
😆George Hughes
Mar 1, 2018, 10:11 PM
George Hughes
Although it's not as annoying 💁‍♂️
Mar 1, 2018, 10:11 PM
George Hughes
Yeah it reminds me of that skidaddle skadoodle your dick is now a noodle😂
Mar 1, 2018, 10:10 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yeah, totally. But I think that's kinda the point lol 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 10:10 PM
George Hughes
Ngl tho his voice is annoying af😂😂
Mar 1, 2018, 10:09 PM
Callum Davies
High praise indeed 😮
Mar 1, 2018, 10:04 PM

7.5 very nices out of 7.5 my child
Mar 1, 2018, 10:03 PM
Callum Davies
How many very nices?

I'll try and find the video that started the meme
Mar 1, 2018, 9:58 PM
George Hughes
Understandable, have a nice day
Mar 1, 2018, 9:58 PM
Callum Davies
Then P E R I S H
Mar 1, 2018, 9:57 PM
George Hughes
Not been keeping up with the memes
Mar 1, 2018, 9:57 PM
George Hughes
I kinda missed that one tho
Mar 1, 2018, 9:57 PM
George Hughes
Well there's that too😂
Mar 1, 2018, 9:57 PM
Callum Davies
I thought it was "Mr Obama? Hewwo?" 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 9:56 PM
George Hughes
💁🏼‍♂️
Mar 1, 2018, 9:56 PM
George Hughes
That was a meme, "hello mr FBI man"
Mar 1, 2018, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
See anything interesting in this chat?
Mar 1, 2018, 9:40 PM
Callum Davies
Hello, governement person
Mar 1, 2018, 9:40 PM
Callum Davies
Even if they were watching, so what?
Mar 1, 2018, 9:39 PM
Callum Davies
Mate, you think the government is interested in this?
Mar 1, 2018, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Hahah true
Mar 1, 2018, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
Also the government are watching, so use a vpn so they can't seeee
Mar 1, 2018, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
As I say, I just tend to use it for LastWeek Tonight. And the drugs was a joke, obviously. The only drugs I get are less VPN more NHS XD
Mar 1, 2018, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
Not that I would ever do that ofc
Mar 1, 2018, 9:37 PM
George Hughes
But if you want full anonymity for buying drugs, use a vpn ;)
Mar 1, 2018, 9:37 PM
George Hughes
That is a good point, tbh I've never actually needed to use a proxy
Mar 1, 2018, 9:36 PM
Callum Davies
So do I, which is why I use a proxy as a get around! XD
Mar 1, 2018, 9:35 PM
George Hughes
I refuse to pay for God tier 😝
Mar 1, 2018, 9:34 PM
Callum Davies
He says, to the man who has consistently had far superior computer knowledge then he'll probably ever have at any point in his life! 😆
Mar 1, 2018, 9:03 PM
Callum Davies
Get on my god tier proxies, scrub! 😆
Mar 1, 2018, 8:59 PM
George Hughes
Nae bad 💁‍♂️

George Hughes
Proxies are good for many things 💊
Mar 1, 2018, 7:32 PM
George Hughes
Ooooh that's great 😆 hope it's not too slow!
Mar 1, 2018, 7:32 PM
Callum Davies
The proxy works!
Mar 1, 2018, 7:18 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, I also buy my drugs using the proxy, but mainly the john oliver thing XD
Mar 1, 2018, 7:15 PM
Callum Davies
The new season in out! :D
Mar 1, 2018, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
It's for watching LastWeek Tonight with John Oliver on youtube. Which is crazy. They upload it to the site, right? So I'm not doing anything illegal by watching it. I use the totally legitimate youtube.com website to view it. But for some reason, they block it off in the UK. So i use that USA proxy to make youtube think my IP is coming in from america, so I can watch the thing they uploaded to the site!
Mar 1, 2018, 7:14 PM
George Hughes
Ooooh what do you need a proxy for? 🤔😏
Mar 1, 2018, 7:11 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 1, 2018, 7:10 PM
Callum Davies
Also, sorry for the late reply. Was busy doing very legal things...
Mar 1, 2018, 7:09 PM
Callum Davies
Because anime
Mar 1, 2018, 7:09 PM
George Hughes
😝
Mar 1, 2018, 7:08 PM
George Hughes
Lmao why is that even a thing
Mar 1, 2018, 7:08 PM
George Hughes
Not when you send gifs like that 😂😂
Mar 1, 2018, 7:08 PM
Callum Davies
You know you love me really ;*
Mar 1, 2018, 7:08 PM

Fs😂
Mar 1, 2018, 7:07 PM

That's good! :D
Mar 1, 2018, 7:07 PM

Mar 1, 2018, 7:06 PM

Also I've now got extensions on my coursework 😎
Mar 1, 2018, 7:06 PM

OOh, that one! Gotcha

Mar 1, 2018, 7:06 PM

That one's just weird 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 7:05 PM
Callum Davies
The licking one?
Mar 1, 2018, 7:03 PM
George Hughes
The one that Kyle always sends 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 7:00 PM
George Hughes
Was looking for a gif
Mar 1, 2018, 7:00 PM

Oops didn't mean to send that lol

Mar 1, 2018, 6:59 PM
Callum Davies
AYYY! Clever pun, my friend. I like that :P
Mar 1, 2018, 6:57 PM
George Hughes
Well you're out of luck my friend, because I also like vegetables
Mar 1, 2018, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, that's a good point. Maybe your stomach is like predator. You've got to stay completely still to avoid its attention. Its vision is based on movement! XD
😆George Hughes
Mar 1, 2018, 6:54 PM
George Hughes
Not sure if you're running to get away from me or running to attract my stomach's attention
Mar 1, 2018, 6:52 PM
Callum Davies
Me 👆🏻
Mar 1, 2018, 6:51 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 1, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
I mean I'd eat those any day, anything that moves is going in my stomach
Mar 1, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Hah

Look up day of the tryffids. Not sure if I've slept it right. But they're living walking plants
Mar 1, 2018, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Tryffids?
Mar 1, 2018, 6:49 PM
Callum Davies
With a possible grey area regarding tryffids
Mar 1, 2018, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
Tasty
Mar 1, 2018, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
Huh
Mar 1, 2018, 6:48 PM
Callum Davies
But like, vore is eating people for sexual pleasure. The furthest away you can get from herbivore! 😆
Mar 1, 2018, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
I mean it is stupid, but it's probably too stupid 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 6:47 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I see😂
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
Maybe it's stupid tho 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM
Callum Davies
Like I know furry and vore separately are
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
And it rolls of the tongue
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
Well it sounds like herbivore?
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM
Callum Davies
Is furryvore a thing?
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
£40 a tyre isn't awful actually
Mar 1, 2018, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
Maybe that's too subtle tho
Mar 1, 2018, 6:45 PM
George Hughes
I think you missed a joke in the chat 😛 Furryvore ;)
Mar 1, 2018, 6:45 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, my types are cheap in relation to other cars, but that's still about £40 a tyre! 😅
Mar 1, 2018, 6:45 PM
George Hughes
Yeah don't want to do that
Mar 1, 2018, 6:44 PM
George Hughes
But he's just abandoned the car
Mar 1, 2018, 6:44 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I just recently got new tyres, so I don't want to be wearing them down spinning on the snow! I'm pretty sure that's what wore down my last set! 😅
Mar 1, 2018, 6:44 PM
George Hughes
I don't know why 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 6:43 PM
Callum Davies
There are Uber drivers working in this!?
Mar 1, 2018, 6:43 PM
George Hughes
The door is open anytime :) but aye, my flatmate sent me a video of a car outside trying to drive off, but the wheels are just spinning helplessly 😂 I think it was an uber eats driver 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, yeah. I might be in Edinburgh in early/mid march, I'm seeing friends there, but I'll see what I can do. Or I could always just come down some other time; I do have a car after all. Just when we can actually see the roads! 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 6:38 PM
George Hughes
Well when you do get the chance, we should do something less alcohol oriented 😆
Mar 1, 2018, 6:36 PM
Callum Davies
Aww, thanks 😊 I'd visit Edinburgh soon if it weren't for the snow! 😅
Mar 1, 2018, 6:35 PM
George Hughes
Awww bro 😎 It takes a cool guy to have cool friends tho😉
Mar 1, 2018, 6:34 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, thanks. I really do have some cool friends, don't I? Especially this guy! 👊🏻
Mar 1, 2018, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I really enjoyed it! You've got some cool friends as well 😁
Mar 1, 2018, 6:31 PM
Callum Davies
Thanks for hanging out again, I had fun on cards against humanity. It's great that we can all still "hang out" in that virtual capacity even though we're all technically snowed in! 😁
Mar 1, 2018, 6:30 PM
George Hughes
Sick, enjoy, catch you later :)
Mar 1, 2018, 5:38 PM
Callum Davies
yeah, it good
Mar 1, 2018, 5:38 PM
George Hughes
I closed the tab
Mar 1, 2018, 5:38 PM
George Hughes
I left?
Mar 1, 2018, 5:38 PM
Callum Davies
You're still in the game, btw
Mar 1, 2018, 5:37 PM
George Hughes
Well I installed teeth in the fridge so that it would bite anyone's fingers off that shouldn't be in there
Mar 1, 2018, 3:42 PM
Callum Davies
Murder your flatmates. Establish dominance!
Mar 1, 2018, 3:41 PM
George Hughes
I've got enough food to get me through as long as no one else helps themselves to it ;)
Mar 1, 2018, 3:40 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, cool 😉
Mar 1, 2018, 3:40 PM
George Hughes
I've not had a proper look yet, but I've got it bookmarked for when I'm a little more experienced
Mar 1, 2018, 3:40 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, enjoy! 😁 Have you had a look at that tim Minchin site I showed you? And yeah, it's the same here. How are you for food?
Mar 1, 2018, 3:20 PM
George Hughes
Snow is insane
Mar 1, 2018, 3:19 PM
George Hughes
Can barely see out the window right now
Mar 1, 2018, 3:19 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's a good idea, I think I'll do some piano
Mar 1, 2018, 3:19 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, you've done some work, and that's good. Don't overwork yourself. Maybe give yourself a half hour of rocket league, or piano?
Mar 1, 2018, 3:16 PM
George Hughes
I'm very bored, don't want to do this any more but there's still looooaaads to do
Mar 1, 2018, 3:14 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 1, 2018, 2:32 PM
George Hughes
Well computing jargon is pretty weird 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 2:30 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I see. When it said pilot, I thought I was a pilot computer or something (that sounds like it could be a thing, right? 😂) Not a literal pilot! 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 2:25 PM
George Hughes
Nope it's a diagram for an airport system hahah
Mar 1, 2018, 2:24 PM
Callum Davies
Computer network infrastructure, that is
Mar 1, 2018, 2:23 PM
Callum Davies
Is that an infrastructure map?
Mar 1, 2018, 2:23 PM
George Hughes

Mar 1, 2018, 2:22 PM
George Hughes
On the contrary, look at this fun stuff
Mar 1, 2018, 2:22 PM
Callum Davies
I know right? 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 2:22 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow that was unexpected😂😂
Mar 1, 2018, 2:21 PM

Apparently what I'm watching! 😂😂 👆🏻
Mar 1, 2018, 1:35 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 1, 2018, 1:35 PM
Callum Davies
God, I hope not! 😬
Mar 1, 2018, 1:19 PM
George Hughes
Maybe it's trying to tell you something? 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 1:18 PM
Callum Davies
I have no idea 😳
Mar 1, 2018, 1:18 PM
George Hughes
Deviants?😂😂
Mar 1, 2018, 1:18 PM
Callum Davies
So yeah, I've been procrastinating by watching deviants, apparently! 😂
Mar 1, 2018, 1:17 PM
Callum Davies
I've been procrastinating by watching John Oliver haha😅 okay, when I put in "by watching" my autocorrect suggested "deviants" 😱
Mar 1, 2018, 1:16 PM
George Hughes
Yep 🙄 but I've been procrastinating by learning some Satie 🎶
Mar 1, 2018, 1:15 PM
Callum Davies
Ohh, so we're both in the same boat lol ⛵
Mar 1, 2018, 1:15 PM
George Hughes
Nah I'm kidding, I've got a piece of work for Monday that I've not done much for as well 🙄
Mar 1, 2018, 1:14 PM
Callum Davies

Mar 1, 2018, 1:14 PM
George Hughes
Hahah so rude 😏
Mar 1, 2018, 1:14 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, probably. I'm sorry. I sent you that message this morning before I realised what I had left to do lol. Sorry mate, didn't mean to troll you 😅
Mar 1, 2018, 1:13 PM
George Hughes
But that'll be fun, haven't played it in ages
Mar 1, 2018, 1:12 PM
George Hughes
We should probably wait until Coursework and stuff has passed
Mar 1, 2018, 1:12 PM
Callum Davies
Hmm, I'll see what I can do, but I've just realised that I've got a piece of work I forgot about and is due on Monday! 😯
Mar 1, 2018, 1:11 PM
George Hughes
Yeah for sure
Mar 1, 2018, 1:10 PM
Callum Davies
If I were to buy rocket league, would you be interested in playing at some point today?
Mar 1, 2018, 10:34 AM
Callum Davies
See ya, my guy. Enjoy the films ❤️
Feb 28, 2018, 8:21 PM
George Hughes
I got my steam working btw 💁‍♂️ Anyways I'm gonna eat some food and lie in bed watching movies 😎 Laters ❤️
Feb 28, 2018, 8:18 PM

Feb 28, 2018, 8:15 PM
George Hughes
All my money comes from being a student, you could say I'm a precessional ;)
Feb 28, 2018, 8:14 PM
Callum Davies
True student, aren't you? 😂 They're clean now! Just gotta be put away 😁
Feb 28, 2018, 8:10 PM
George Hughes
Shall chat later then 😁
Feb 28, 2018, 8:10 PM
George Hughes
Just turn them inside out ;)
Feb 28, 2018, 8:09 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, I should really start to put away this washing if I want any pants for tomorrow. So I'll message you later 😉
Feb 28, 2018, 8:09 PM
George Hughes
I gotcha 😆
Feb 28, 2018, 8:08 PM
Callum Davies
I'm joking 😆 don't worry
Feb 28, 2018, 8:07 PM
George Hughes
Guuuuyyyyy
Feb 28, 2018, 8:07 PM
George Hughes
But anyway: He's a family
Feb 28, 2018, 8:07 PM
George Hughes
It's not all doom and gloom 😢
Feb 28, 2018, 8:07 PM
Callum Davies
Everything that makes us, sob and cry!
Feb 28, 2018, 8:05 PM
George Hughes
Lucky there's a man who positively can do 🎶
Feb 28, 2018, 8:04 PM
Callum Davies
#Lucky there's a family guy!#
Feb 28, 2018, 8:04 PM
George Hughes
Hahah good family man 😎
Feb 28, 2018, 8:03 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, perish the thought! 😁
Feb 28, 2018, 8:03 PM
George Hughes
Ayy that's great, you must be sick of them now ;)
Feb 28, 2018, 8:02 PM
Callum Davies
We did 😁
Feb 28, 2018, 8:02 PM
George Hughes
I'm sure they'd looove to play a board game😂
Feb 28, 2018, 8:02 PM
George Hughes
Agreed 🙄 but mind that card tho, why don't you sit down and eat as a proper family for once!
Feb 28, 2018, 8:01 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck this snow! 😡
😢George Hughes
Feb 28, 2018, 7:24 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, probably. Probably be with a group chat of one of my friends'
Feb 28, 2018, 2:55 PM
George Hughes
I'll let you know if the wifi stops cutting off cause a game would be fun, would you do it over the xyzz website thing?
Feb 28, 2018, 2:54 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, no! 😂
Feb 28, 2018, 2:52 PM
George Hughes
I was trying to cook a pizza and every time I turned the oven on, the power went out for the building and we had to get help 😂
Feb 28, 2018, 2:52 PM
George Hughes
Although we did lose power last week 😢
Feb 28, 2018, 2:51 PM
George Hughes
I am free, but if it was on a call, my internet keeps cutting out so that might be a bit of an issue 😂 Still got power, haven't resorted to candles yet
Feb 28, 2018, 2:51 PM
Callum Davies
That's okay. Are you free ATM, because I'm seeing about putting together a cards against humanity group for just now, if you want 😁
Feb 28, 2018, 2:49 PM
George Hughes
Let me try steam again
Feb 28, 2018, 2:48 PM
George Hughes
I've not been able to log into steam for some reason 😕 but I do have it installed
Feb 28, 2018, 2:48 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough! 😂 Wait, do you still have rocket league on your computer?
Feb 28, 2018, 2:47 PM
George Hughes
Yeah there's probably a few other issues there 😂 although I did say I wouldn't do it 😇
Feb 28, 2018, 2:46 PM
Callum Davies
I feel in that situation, the snow is not the main problem! 😂
Feb 28, 2018, 2:45 PM
George Hughes
That is true
Feb 28, 2018, 2:44 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but somebody who doesn't have a driving license shouldn't be driving anyway 😕
Feb 28, 2018, 2:43 PM
George Hughes
I guess, but like if someone who doesn't have a driving license drove in the snow, it would probably end horribly
Feb 28, 2018, 2:42 PM
Callum Davies
Yellow warning is just "be aware". Yup, there is snow. K bye, going to the shops! 😂
Feb 28, 2018, 2:41 PM
George Hughes
(Unless it was really necessary)
Feb 28, 2018, 2:40 PM
George Hughes
😝
Feb 28, 2018, 2:40 PM
George Hughes
I see your logic 😂 but I still wouldn't drive in a yellow warning
Feb 28, 2018, 2:40 PM
Callum Davies
See? I do have sense. I'm not going out in a red warning! 😬😂
Feb 28, 2018, 2:40 PM
Callum Davies
Too late now though 😂
Feb 28, 2018, 2:39 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. I know. Which is I wanted to go whilst it was still just a yellow warning
Feb 28, 2018, 2:39 PM
George Hughes
And a risk of death
Feb 28, 2018, 2:39 PM
George Hughes
There's a red warning
Feb 28, 2018, 2:39 PM
George Hughes
Apparently it's supposed to get really heavy here at 3
Feb 28, 2018, 2:39 PM
George Hughes
Bang on 😎
Feb 28, 2018, 2:38 PM
Callum Davies
Fair point. I know it's just because people care about me 😊
Feb 28, 2018, 2:37 PM
George Hughes
Eeeeven if you have been okay in the past, it doesn't mean it's a good idea 💁‍♂️😂

I'm sorry, it just seems like I'm the only person in the world who's actually able to adapt their driving style to suit the current conditions! 😂
Feb 28, 2018, 2:35 PM
Callum Davies
I've made it to Oban and Aberfeldy repeatedly in conditions like these, I drove to the doctor just today, I get up the flipping hill on the estate multiple times every day on days like this. And I've NEVER had to claim on the insurance! So many instances of driving perfectly in conditions like these, and people still say I can't drive in conditions like these. I'd agree with them, if not for the OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE!!!
Feb 28, 2018, 2:34 PM
George Hughes
Add me to that list, you better not drive in this 😂
Feb 28, 2018, 2:32 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I'm trapped to. Not because I can't drive, like. Just nobody will let me! 😂

Feb 28, 2018, 9:29 AM
Callum Davies
Well, college is closed. But I've still got an appointment with the doctor to check up on my ADHD medication and all that
Feb 28, 2018, 9:28 AM

You up to much today? Or has the snow cancelled your plans 🙄
Feb 28, 2018, 9:24 AM

Feb 27, 2018, 8:19 PM

Cool mums B)
Feb 27, 2018, 8:18 PM
George Hughes
That's how it happened for me as well 😎
Feb 27, 2018, 8:18 PM
Callum Davies
I just talked to mum calmly and rationally about it. I said "I've been thinking about getting a tattoo, what do you think about it? I've been thinking about getting this, on the shoulder, but not anytime soon because it'll be quite expensive" and then mum suggested me getting it for my birthday
Feb 27, 2018, 8:15 PM
George Hughes
Glad your mum supports it, I know some folk who's parents would go crazy if their kid got one 🙄
Feb 27, 2018, 8:13 PM
Callum Davies
Mum suggested as much (because of the expense!)
Feb 27, 2018, 8:12 PM
George Hughes
Sick when you gonna get it done? Would your parents let you have it as a bday present?
Feb 27, 2018, 8:11 PM

Feb 27, 2018, 8:11 PM
George Hughes
Are you still planning on getting that hitchhikers tattoo?
Feb 27, 2018, 8:10 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I get that. I guess I'd just let her create, then ask her if it was cool if I got a tattoo of it 😅
Feb 27, 2018, 8:09 PM
George Hughes
I would as well but i wouldn't want to put that much pressure on her 😆
Feb 27, 2018, 8:08 PM
Callum Davies
I'm sorry. You know I think it's great! I'd genuinely commission her to design me a tattoo; her work is awesome! 😄
Feb 27, 2018, 7:59 PM
George Hughes
Bbs
Feb 27, 2018, 7:58 PM

Well it owns my phone case, which is like a vessel for capturing the souls of those who spy it
Feb 27, 2018, 7:56 PM
Callum Davies
I'm pretty sure that image now owns my souls. Which is weird, because I thought that already belonged to the devil
Feb 27, 2018, 7:56 PM
George Hughes
Or soul 😂😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:55 PM
Callum Davies
It's not really an image that's pleasing to the eye. Or soul...😳
Feb 27, 2018, 7:54 PM

It's not really a name that rolls off the tongue 😂

Well it's very modernistic, probably cursed as well 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:49 PM
Callum Davies
Because, her art is cursed! 😁 Very good, but also very cursed 😂 Nah, you know I'm joking 😉
Feb 27, 2018, 7:48 PM
George Hughes
Too edgy?
Feb 27, 2018, 7:48 PM
George Hughes
Hahah why not art? 😆
Feb 27, 2018, 7:47 PM

I've just read a paragraph she sent me and it's astounding how well she grasps our language and its nuances
Feb 27, 2018, 7:47 PM

Just...not an art book...😳

George Hughes
If I wrote a book, you'd probably be the only one to read it and understand, and probably the only one to read it
Feb 27, 2018, 7:36 PM
George Hughes
I feel like most people reading that sentence would be put off by how long it is, and if not, then for sure by the words I've used 😂😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:36 PM
Callum Davies
You put it far more eloquently than I ever could have. You should write a book 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:34 PM
George Hughes
Maybe I didn't word that right, but am I on the right lines? 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:33 PM
George Hughes
So kinda like all oxymorons are juxtapositions but not vice versa, where oxymorons would be the clashing of denotations of adjectives and nouns and juxtapositions would be a composition of words that denote clashing?
Feb 27, 2018, 7:33 PM
Callum Davies
Well, an oxymoron is more of a fundamental opposition whereas juxtaposition is more of pointing out a contrast between two things for poetic effect. So slightly different, I think, but on the whole, pretty much the same thing
Feb 27, 2018, 7:31 PM
George Hughes
What's the difference between the two? I think I meant oxymoron but I couldn't think of the word
Feb 27, 2018, 7:29 PM
Callum Davies

😆George Hughes
Feb 27, 2018, 7:28 PM
Callum Davies
Juxtaposition and oxymoron are somewhat synonyms of each other.
Feb 27, 2018, 7:28 PM
George Hughes
If constructive procrastination isn't a juxtaposition (can't remember if that's the right word)
Feb 27, 2018, 7:27 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 27, 2018, 7:26 PM

Although usually I procrastinate constructively by playing piano or guitar 💁🏼‍♂️

Feb 27, 2018, 7:26 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, procrastinating together! 🙏🏻
Feb 27, 2018, 7:24 PM
George Hughes
Well at least you can take comfort in the knowledge that you're doing the same 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:24 PM
Callum Davies
I wish I could say I wasn't doing the same 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:23 PM
George Hughes
No I'm not gonna do it now, I am going to keep procrastinating 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:23 PM
Callum Davies
Well, you can't blame that one on me! 😂 Is this a case of "I'm now gonna do it, so bye" or am I good to keep talking?
Feb 27, 2018, 7:22 PM
George Hughes
Well I also inadvertently reminded myself so I am also annoyed and worried
Feb 27, 2018, 7:21 PM
Callum Davies
Don't remind me! 😓
Feb 27, 2018, 7:20 PM
George Hughes
Hahah it's okay 😝 take your time and relax, after all you're gonna need to find time to do your coursework 😉 (handy reminder)
Feb 27, 2018, 7:20 PM
Callum Davies
I really am trying to. Sometime next week, is what I'm thinking 😰 God, I hate being this busy 😅
Feb 27, 2018, 7:18 PM

Aww haha, better fit her in that calendar soon bro 😎
Feb 27, 2018, 7:17 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I see 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:17 PM
George Hughes
In case you're wondering why it reminds me of her, it's cause she sends me click bait article titles sometimes 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 7:17 PM
Callum Davies
Not actually had a chance to have it yet! I know, I know! My social calendar is just crazy at the moment! I honestly am trying to have it with her as soon as I can! 😩
Feb 27, 2018, 7:16 PM

It's not exam season yet, but it's near
Feb 27, 2018, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
You're lecturers have been on strike in the middle of exam season? Isn't that a little irresponsible?
Feb 27, 2018, 6:40 PM
George Hughes
I'm kinda worried cause our lecturers have been on strike and if we can't attend because weather or the lecturer can't make it in, we're gonna have problems
Feb 27, 2018, 6:39 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, really? Maybe it is quite serious then 😕
Feb 27, 2018, 6:36 PM

I think the news is talking about the snow that's still to come 🤔
Feb 27, 2018, 6:31 PM

Meh, so so. It's settling, but nothing you can't adapt to. Of course, the news is blowing it way out of proportion, but what did we expect! 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 6:30 PM

Yeah, it's pretty grim.. how's the snow where you are? Mum said brig is white
Feb 27, 2018, 6:29 PM

Feb 27, 2018, 6:25 PM

Sometimes you just gotta switch off your phone and do something you enjoy eh, although it's often better with someone otherwise it gets boring 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 6:23 PM

Ha ha, that can get a bit much sometimes. I sometimes feel like I'm never "off" 😅
Feb 27, 2018, 6:23 PM

Well it's not bad but I would rather play piano than have to speak to people all the time 💁🏼‍♂️
Feb 27, 2018, 6:22 PM

Aww, I'm sure you're social life isn't that bad! 😂 And that's a fair point lol 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 6:20 PM
George Hughes
Well I can do the social life part 💁🏼‍♂️ but I'm afraid I still have to pay for electricity bills for an electric piano 🙄
Feb 27, 2018, 6:19 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, ah well. You've just got to eschew any sort of social life and practice for years with every hour that God sends. Not that difficult! 😂
Feb 27, 2018, 6:15 PM

Hahah I was hoping they would be but I've pretty much had to start from complete basics and take things real slow

Sick, you should make business xards 😎
Feb 22, 2018, 11:49 AM
Callum Davies
I plan to
Feb 22, 2018, 11:31 AM
George Hughes
Awesome, you should totally network with folk while you're there ;)
Feb 22, 2018, 11:15 AM
Callum Davies
Nah, it's in Dundee
Feb 22, 2018, 11:12 AM
George Hughes
Is your gig at the college?
Feb 22, 2018, 10:56 AM
Callum Davies
Oh yes! 😎
Feb 22, 2018, 10:54 AM
George Hughes
Unless your Elvis where you have a big slapback right behind your vocal 😎
Feb 22, 2018, 10:52 AM
George Hughes
It's generally best ad a subtle effect 💁‍♂️ the idea of keeping the mix down is to make sure there's still plenty room left for other sounds
Feb 22, 2018, 10:52 AM
Callum Davies
Ohh, thanks. I'll try it out and impress everyone 😁
Feb 22, 2018, 10:51 AM
George Hughes
Ahh, basically you want to have the tempo about middle and the mix down to about 20% and it'll sound quite good on guitar solos or spacy vocals
Feb 22, 2018, 10:50 AM
Callum Davies
No, 3 tap delay. It literally delays it 3 times a second, or something like that. You play a note and it just goes "bum-bum-bum" it well, taps 3 times. I cannot work out what it's for, because I've heard audio it actually sounds good on! 😂
Feb 22, 2018, 10:48 AM
George Hughes
Tape delay?? 😮
Yes getting too reverb happy will sound awful 👌🏼
Feb 22, 2018, 10:47 AM
Callum Davies
Put a 3 tap delay on it. Sounds awful! Maybe too much reverb as well
Feb 22, 2018, 10:45 AM
George Hughes
And plenty of delay delay delay delay....
Feb 22, 2018, 10:45 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, yes! Great idea!
Feb 22, 2018, 10:44 AM
George Hughes
I hope there is a pitch changer there 😂

Feb 16, 2018, 6:17 PM
George Hughes
Like man haters who want all men to die because they're men, I find it hard to believe that anyone feels like that 😂
Feb 16, 2018, 6:16 PM
George Hughes
Wew, pretty much everything I've seen on tumblr has been so far removed from reality that it seems like ironic humour
Feb 16, 2018, 6:15 PM
Callum Davies
Some of them 😂
Feb 16, 2018, 6:14 PM
George Hughes
Does that imply that people on tumblr take themselves seriously? 😂😂😂
Feb 16, 2018, 6:14 PM
George Hughes
Huh
Feb 16, 2018, 6:13 PM
Callum Davies
In some circles
Feb 16, 2018, 6:12 PM
George Hughes
Hahah is it controversial to think tumblr is a silly place?
Feb 16, 2018, 6:11 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 16, 2018, 6:10 PM
George Hughes
Well yeah there is tumblr
Feb 16, 2018, 6:09 PM

I'm not sure they sell birds, I asked if they had any seagulls last time I was there and they told me to leave or they'd call security
Feb 16, 2018, 5:24 PM

You've got to hand it to him tho, he's very good at campaigning 😂😂
Feb 14, 2018, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies
I know right!? He's barely into his first term, and he's already planning the campaign for his second! 😩
Feb 14, 2018, 1:06 PM
George Hughes
Very presumptuous 🤔 in fact if I didn't already hear about that, I would think you were joking 😂
Feb 14, 2018, 1:05 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I get that's a joke. But he's genuinely revealed his 2020 campaign motto already. He did it about 6 months after his inauguration. It's going to be "Keep America Great" 😑
Feb 14, 2018, 1:04 PM

Now the media are going to spend a week analysing what he said to interrupt it even tho it means nothing

Starting to look more like my good old self lol 😁
Feb 14, 2018, 12:55 PM
George Hughes
As I say, time isn't the determining factor for how much you mean. That is a naive correlation to see 🙂
That's great news, glad you're getting back on the right track 😁
Feb 14, 2018, 12:55 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. It just sucks that it took her such a short amount of time to get over it, you know? But hey, I'm eating healthily again, and beginning to exercise again
Feb 14, 2018, 12:53 PM
George Hughes
Then instead of pretending everything is okay, it actually will be okay
Feb 14, 2018, 12:52 PM
George Hughes
It's okay to be angry. But I think that anger is stemming from unhealthy beliefs, maybe you could use this to try understand what goes on in your head
Feb 14, 2018, 12:52 PM
Callum Davies
I know I am. But right now I feel like I need to be. I always look out for other people. And I always get hurt. I never let myself get angry or feel any sort of negative emotion. I always tried to be the bigger person. I mean, look! I try to clear things out with her, and the only reason she agrees is because she happens to be in Perth meeting this new fella! I'm sorry, but right now, I'm angry, and I'm letting myself be angry
Feb 14, 2018, 12:49 PM
George Hughes
If you truly love her, you'll know she needs to figure it out alone
Feb 14, 2018, 12:48 PM
George Hughes
Time isn't the determining factor of how much someone means.
There's the possibility that she needed a rebound to cope.
And even if she has healed quick, you surely must be happy for her if you truly love her. I hate to say it but you're being selfish :(
Feb 14, 2018, 12:47 PM
Callum Davies
Because why should I always have to be the one who tries to make things better? Aren't I allowed to feel hurt? And not because of that, but 2 weeks!? It's going to take MONTHS for me until I feel ready to get close to anyone like that again. 2 weeks!? Well at least now I know how much I meant to her
Feb 14, 2018, 12:44 PM
George Hughes
Are you saying she doesn't deserve closure because she met someone?
Feb 14, 2018, 12:43 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I'm feeling less like granting that kindness, put it that way
Feb 14, 2018, 12:42 PM
George Hughes
And now you don't want to clear the air because of him?
Feb 14, 2018, 12:41 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I asked her before I learned of this new guy. Because God forbid I should want to try to clear the air between us two!
Feb 14, 2018, 12:40 PM
George Hughes
What made you two decide to meet for a coffee?
Feb 14, 2018, 12:40 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. Barely 2 weeks since the break up. She's got a new "friend". Kinda difficult to be very chill about that little fact 😒
Feb 14, 2018, 12:39 PM
George Hughes
Just be chill about it 😅
Feb 14, 2018, 12:38 PM
Callum Davies
So I'm meeting Julia for coffee today. I'm not sure what's gonna happen lol

Feb 12, 2018, 2:04 PM
George Hughes
I might do some work then
Feb 12, 2018, 2:02 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, let's get this done. Or started, at any rate 😅
Feb 12, 2018, 2:01 PM

Haha that'd probably work fairly well 😂
Feb 12, 2018, 2:01 PM

Oh no. We should have a study session next time you're in brig. Hey, I'll do my thing if you do yours lol
Feb 12, 2018, 2:00 PM

Me too bro 🙄
Feb 12, 2018, 1:59 PM

Yeah I know. But I'm finding it really difficult finding the motivation to do it 😅

Trust me, put in some time every day and you'll manage :)
Feb 12, 2018, 1:52 PM

It's almost as good as when Gavin took coke, started assaulting people, then got run over by an electric wheelchair and escorted home by a guy with an automatic weapon
Feb 11, 2018, 2:03 PM
Callum Davies
Oh wow. No, I really can't top that 😂
Feb 11, 2018, 2:02 PM
George Hughes
Bet you couldn't top that ;)
Feb 11, 2018, 2:02 PM
George Hughes
Well basically this band that formed from Rockshop played at a nice venue called Bannerman's in Edinburgh. And they provide accommodation for touring bands.

So after they played, the next morning they woke up to spray paint all over the walls in the rooms they stayed in, and the bedding had been binned and other random shit.

So they did a runner and Bannerman's took to the internet to complain. It ended up all over the news and the kids have been getting death threats from hundreds of people online.
Feb 11, 2018, 2:01 PM
Callum Davies
Oh? 😂
Feb 11, 2018, 1:59 PM
George Hughes
And if you think that's bad, you haven't heard about the Rockshop kids that trashed a venue the other day
Feb 11, 2018, 1:58 PM

I suppose. Thanks
Feb 10, 2018, 1:42 PM
George Hughes
See what she says I guess
Feb 10, 2018, 1:41 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that's totally understandable. Apparently Zoe's not doing too well either. And well, I guess the weird question is this; would it be weird if I were to have a coffee or something with Zoë? Now, I know her and I do have a past, but don't worry, it's not anything like that! 😬 I do genuinely just want to be there for her as a friend, somebody to talk to about it, you know? Obviously, I'm here for you as well, but I guess I'm just asking if you think it would be weird, of even helpful, if I were to do that.
Feb 10, 2018, 1:37 PM
George Hughes
Thanks for asking 😊 I'm fine I think, but sometimes I worry about Mum
Feb 10, 2018, 1:34 PM
Callum Davies
Well, Mum just came up to my room and told me that she'd been talking to your mum, and apparently there's some stuff going on in your household at the moment. I hope you don't mind my knowing that, but why didn't you tell me that, man? Are you alright? You know I'm here you, man
Feb 10, 2018, 1:28 PM
George Hughes
Sure haha

They are musical notes, but they are also coding languages 😎
Feb 8, 2018, 12:34 PM

You're having me on. Those last three are just musical notes, surely?
Feb 8, 2018, 12:33 PM
George Hughes
And C+
Feb 8, 2018, 12:33 PM
George Hughes
There's C, C++, C#, F, F# and many many more
Feb 8, 2018, 12:33 PM

Just c? I've only ever heard of c++ 😂 I know nothing!
Feb 8, 2018, 12:32 PM

Well it's an option, we were using c
Feb 8, 2018, 12:32 PM
Callum Davies
Wait, it is python that the pi uses, isn't it?
Feb 8, 2018, 12:31 PM
George Hughes
Hahahah nope but that is along the lines of what I did last year 😂
Feb 8, 2018, 12:31 PM
Callum Davies
Because you used python?
Feb 8, 2018, 12:30 PM
George Hughes
That is true haha
Feb 8, 2018, 12:30 PM
George Hughes
But cause I used a system that I deemed more legible, they took off marks cause it wasn't exactly how they wanted it 🙄
Feb 8, 2018, 12:30 PM
Callum Davies
Nice. And you should. Plenty of people make a living selling source code
Feb 8, 2018, 12:30 PM
George Hughes
Got nearly full marks
Feb 8, 2018, 12:29 PM

It was decent, many people used my code 😎 need to start charging folk

Falling asleep in a big comfy bed with not a care in the world 😇
Feb 8, 2018, 9:47 AM
Callum Davies
What?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:46 AM
George Hughes
You know what idea I'm really attached to right now?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
😆
Feb 8, 2018, 9:46 AM
George Hughes
Jk thank you 😝
Feb 8, 2018, 9:45 AM
George Hughes
I thought you said I didn't need luck 😉
Feb 8, 2018, 9:45 AM
Callum Davies
Good luck 😎
Feb 8, 2018, 9:45 AM
George Hughes
Some time between 10:15 and 11:15, depends when the markers get round to me
Feb 8, 2018, 9:45 AM
Callum Davies
When's your pi assessment today?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:44 AM
George Hughes
Haha
Feb 8, 2018, 9:44 AM
Callum Davies

Feb 8, 2018, 9:43 AM
Callum Davies
Hmm 😕
Feb 8, 2018, 9:43 AM
George Hughes
It's okay to care about her, but you're attached to an idea, and that's not really her.
Feb 8, 2018, 9:43 AM
Callum Davies
😕
Feb 8, 2018, 9:42 AM
Callum Davies
I get that. And I know I won't be able to let her go until I stop worrying about what she thinks about me, but that's really difficult because I do still care about her
Feb 8, 2018, 9:41 AM
George Hughes
But why can't you spend the rest of your life with her, romanticism is a strange perception: it means you love one person more than everyone else and that is odd, and it never works because we're human
Feb 8, 2018, 9:40 AM
Callum Davies
😊 I get that. But it's not really the same, is it? There's a difference between your friends and the person you want to spend the rest of your life with
Feb 8, 2018, 9:39 AM
George Hughes
Haha*
Feb 8, 2018, 9:38 AM
George Hughes
Should be a colon after friends hash
Feb 8, 2018, 9:38 AM
George Hughes
I love my family, I love my friends, I love Kyle, I love you 💁‍♂️
Feb 8, 2018, 9:38 AM
George Hughes
I don't believe so, if you love someone, then you love them unconditionally
Feb 8, 2018, 9:37 AM
Callum Davies
Surely that's counterintuitive? Surely if you really love someone, you'll never be able to just be friends?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:37 AM
George Hughes
If you really love her, you'll love her as a friend
Feb 8, 2018, 9:36 AM
George Hughes
You can still be friends with them, but it'd maybe best if you met up with them when she's not there. And with time you'll be able to become friends with her again
Feb 8, 2018, 9:36 AM
Callum Davies
I can't cut her out my life without cutting Jasper, and by extension Kyle out as well. You see my predicament?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:34 AM
George Hughes
I think you need to let her go from your life and you'll get your answer about whether you she wants you in hers after you do that
Feb 8, 2018, 9:33 AM
George Hughes
Thing is, you're not going to be able to let go if you still worry about what she thinks of you, and by asking her questions like that, it's making it more difficult on you 😕
Feb 8, 2018, 9:33 AM
Callum Davies
I understand that thinking. Thank you. I almost want to say thank you to her! Because although we may be through, she still did give me some of the best and happiest times of my life
Feb 8, 2018, 9:31 AM
Callum Davies
Can I tell you what is really difficult?

I asked her a few days ago whether she genuinely wanted me to remain in her life, and she understandably said she didn't know and that she'd think about it. Not having an answer yet is killing me; but I obviously don't want to push her for an answer. But knowing her, she's just as likely fucking forgotten that I'd even asked her by now
Feb 8, 2018, 9:30 AM
George Hughes
Listen sometimes it's best to make a conscious decision to let her go, I know that sounds sad but you have to say to yourself if you want to get over her, you will
Feb 8, 2018, 9:29 AM
George Hughes
It's okay :)
Feb 8, 2018, 9:28 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah 😔 I'm sorry for keep banging on about it
Feb 8, 2018, 9:28 AM
George Hughes
It's never easy 🙄
Feb 8, 2018, 9:28 AM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, fuck. It's been about 2 weeks now, but I still miss her. How long is this gonna take? 😩
Feb 8, 2018, 9:27 AM
George Hughes
Can't wait to sleep 😂
Feb 8, 2018, 9:27 AM
Callum Davies
Aww, no! 😖
Feb 8, 2018, 9:14 AM
George Hughes
Took me an hour to realise *facepalms*
Feb 8, 2018, 9:11 AM
Callum Davies
😂
Feb 8, 2018, 9:11 AM
George Hughes
Like they're both numbers
Feb 8, 2018, 9:11 AM
George Hughes
Very easy mistake to make mind you, they've got a lot in common
Feb 8, 2018, 9:11 AM
Callum Davies
That'll do it
Feb 8, 2018, 9:11 AM
George Hughes
Nope, because I put a 4 instead of a 1
Feb 8, 2018, 9:10 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, no! Because it's only got like a kilobyte of ram?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:10 AM
George Hughes
And you know why?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:09 AM
George Hughes
It kept crashing
Feb 8, 2018, 9:09 AM
George Hughes
I thought I broke the pi multiple times lmao
Feb 8, 2018, 9:09 AM
Callum Davies

Feb 8, 2018, 9:08 AM
George Hughes
Nooo don't say that😂 it'll end up happening!!
Feb 8, 2018, 9:08 AM
George Hughes
Hahah I say home for both here and brig 💁‍♂️
Feb 8, 2018, 9:08 AM
Callum Davies
Full day. In till 5. It's so confusing when you say "home" 😂 I always think you mean brig. Also, be a shame if one of those capacitors blew 😂
Feb 8, 2018, 9:06 AM
George Hughes
I'm going straight home to sleep after it's marked.. You got much on today?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:05 AM
Callum Davies
Ah, I getcha
Feb 8, 2018, 9:04 AM
George Hughes
That and coding
Feb 8, 2018, 9:04 AM
George Hughes
Hahah I wish
Feb 8, 2018, 9:04 AM
Callum Davies
Just plugging in wires?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:04 AM
George Hughes
That's what I've been doing all night 😂
Feb 8, 2018, 9:03 AM
George Hughes

Feb 8, 2018, 9:03 AM
Callum Davies
I'm sure 😁
Feb 8, 2018, 9:03 AM
George Hughes
Yeah to the highest standard 😎
Feb 8, 2018, 9:03 AM
Callum Davies
Ohh, is it done now though?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:03 AM
George Hughes
Just a lab to get marked, I stupidly left the work til the last minute tho so I've literally been working all night to get it done 😂
Feb 8, 2018, 9:02 AM
Callum Davies
Many classes on today?
Feb 8, 2018, 9:01 AM
George Hughes
Oh haha well hope you enjoy whatever that is :P
Feb 6, 2018, 6:48 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, sorry. I'm just heading off to adventure Circus now 😂
Feb 6, 2018, 6:44 PM
George Hughes
Hejo
Feb 6, 2018, 6:43 PM
Callum Davies
Hi
Feb 6, 2018, 6:17 PM
George Hughes
Okieee, chat soon then
Feb 6, 2018, 3:14 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, sorry. I'm gonna need to be heading home now.
Feb 6, 2018, 3:14 PM
George Hughes
Cut off the brown bits
Feb 6, 2018, 3:14 PM
George Hughes
Remember to prune your child
Feb 6, 2018, 3:13 PM
Callum Davies
True.
Feb 6, 2018, 3:13 PM
George Hughes
Well they should eat the things that their children biologically produce then dispose of them when they're no longer interesting
Feb 6, 2018, 3:12 PM
Callum Davies
Basically, parents should eat their children. I think this is the conclusion we should draw from this
Feb 6, 2018, 3:11 PM
George Hughes
He still had the joy of letting a banana tree be
Feb 6, 2018, 3:11 PM
George Hughes
because his electricity bill is exceedingly high
Feb 6, 2018, 3:11 PM
George Hughes
Even if by the time it becomes a teenager, he utterly despises it and wants it to leave his house
Feb 6, 2018, 3:10 PM
George Hughes
But that man has had the pleasure of owning and tending to his beautiful baby banana tree
Feb 6, 2018, 3:09 PM
Callum Davies
Give a man a banana, he will eat for a day. Give a man a mini banana tree, he will be sick of eating mini bananas by the end of the year
Feb 6, 2018, 3:03 PM
George Hughes
all i want in life is a mini banana tree
Feb 6, 2018, 3:02 PM
George Hughes

If I knew how to knit I would, instead i just sing them songs
Feb 6, 2018, 3:00 PM
Callum Davies
I genuinely believe that's something you would actually do! 😂
Feb 6, 2018, 2:59 PM
George Hughes
That would be accurate, need to knit some tiny pyjamas for my bananaas tho
Feb 6, 2018, 2:58 PM
Callum Davies
Just some of the things you can expect to see if you begin growing weed in your flat! 😂
Feb 6, 2018, 2:58 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 6, 2018, 2:57 PM

how cool would that be
Feb 6, 2018, 2:57 PM
George Hughes
Here I could grow a mini banana tree
Feb 6, 2018, 2:57 PM
George Hughes
When you said get ya, I was wondering if you meant that, but didn't want to say lmao
Feb 6, 2018, 2:56 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that took you so long to realise 😂
Feb 6, 2018, 2:56 PM

I mean literally grow tropical plants in my room hahah although if that becomes legal then yeah 😂

Positively dank 👌🏻
Feb 6, 2018, 2:54 PM
George Hughes
payoff?
Feb 6, 2018, 2:54 PM
Callum Davies
Good payoff though
Feb 6, 2018, 2:54 PM
George Hughes
aww I imagine that'd use a lot of electricity
Feb 6, 2018, 2:54 PM
Callum Davies
You'll need a hydrophonic lamp to do that properly though
Feb 6, 2018, 2:53 PM
George Hughes
Is it relatable for a room to be so warm I literally sweat the second I walk in?
Feb 6, 2018, 2:53 PM
George Hughes
get me?
Feb 6, 2018, 2:53 PM
Callum Davies
Ehhhhh! I get ya 😉
Feb 6, 2018, 2:52 PM
George Hughes
need to start growing tropical plants
Feb 6, 2018, 2:52 PM

it feels like a jungle in here tho, when I walk in the humidity hits me like a brick
Feb 6, 2018, 2:52 PM

Somebody looking at the YouTube algorithm
Feb 6, 2018, 2:40 PM

they figured it out and made it to that top
Feb 6, 2018, 2:40 PM

It's more of a keyboard than a piano so it sadly won't be too comedic

Hahah luckily I'm ground floor 😂
Feb 6, 2018, 2:16 PM

I'll show you when it arrives, but it either comes this saturday or next... very excited to get it!

One last clue, I ordered a full size one
Feb 6, 2018, 12:12 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I dunno
Feb 6, 2018, 12:11 PM
George Hughes
Well here's another clue, it has to be plugged in to be used😮
Feb 6, 2018, 12:09 PM
Callum Davies
Well, which one?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:08 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
Feb 6, 2018, 12:08 PM
Callum Davies
It's either a drum or a dildo
Feb 6, 2018, 12:07 PM
George Hughes
Here's a clue, it's has hammer action to make it feel better 😅
Feb 6, 2018, 12:07 PM
Callum Davies
What is it then?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:05 PM
George Hughes
Haha jk nah it's not a mic 😆
Feb 6, 2018, 12:05 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I dropped the old one 🙄
Feb 6, 2018, 12:05 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno. A new microphone?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:05 PM
George Hughes
Guess :p
Feb 6, 2018, 12:04 PM
Callum Davies
What?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:04 PM

Not much apart from let yourself get back into a normal routine I guess
Feb 6, 2018, 12:03 PM

Eh, still a bit shit. But what can you do?
Feb 6, 2018, 12:02 PM

Not baddd, you?

Hi
Feb 6, 2018, 11:57 AM

Feb 5, 2018, 7:09 PM
Callum Davies
I never really gave it any thought, to be honest
Feb 5, 2018, 6:20 PM

See how oo makes an ew sound, is it just me that uses an odd number of o's to extend the oh sound and and even number of o's to extend the ew?

There's an AI called Inspirobot who generated motivational images and quotes based on ones that people have made. Check it out, it's addictive 😂

George Hughes
If you know what I mean
Feb 5, 2018, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
I guess I also think don't "try" to do things inside your head, just let it be and it will sort itself out
Feb 5, 2018, 4:46 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. I'll try not to
Feb 5, 2018, 4:44 PM
George Hughes
I know sometimes I get caught in traps with feeling guilty and it's no use
Feb 5, 2018, 4:44 PM
George Hughes
But don't feel guilty for still feeling bad even when you remember how grateful you are, emotions are complicated
Feb 5, 2018, 4:44 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I should
Feb 5, 2018, 4:41 PM
George Hughes
I guess you write a bunch of sticky notes with all the things you're grateful for?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:41 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, yeah. I need to work on not doing that lol
Feb 5, 2018, 4:40 PM
George Hughes
It's easy to forget 🙄
Feb 5, 2018, 4:40 PM

Feb 5, 2018, 4:39 PM

You can have many loves in life 😘😘
Feb 5, 2018, 4:39 PM
Callum Davies
I know that 😊 Thank you so much
Feb 5, 2018, 4:38 PM
George Hughes
It's just cause part of our culture states that you must have a life partner to be happy. But that doesn't have to be true
Feb 5, 2018, 4:38 PM
George Hughes
But you're not alone
Feb 5, 2018, 4:38 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. I keep thinking how much later though. I don't like being alone
Feb 5, 2018, 4:36 PM
George Hughes
Well life works in weird ways, maybe there's lessons to be learned from this that will help you later on?

There are times now when I'll look in the mirror and think to myself "Looking pretty good" but then my brain just goes to "Why didn't you have this confidence when you were with Julia? It's too late now, isn't it?"
Feb 5, 2018, 4:33 PM
George Hughes
Spend some time with your brother, your hatred of every little thing he does ought to adjust your focus ;)
Feb 5, 2018, 4:33 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I know. I really do try. I'm just finding it really difficult.
Feb 5, 2018, 4:32 PM
George Hughes
I think it's best you find something to occupy your mind, even if you don't feel motivated at first
Feb 5, 2018, 4:31 PM
George Hughes
Trying to stop thinking about someone will only make you think about them more
Feb 5, 2018, 4:30 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. Oh, Christ. I'm sorry. It still hurts so much. I should be doing work, but I just can't concentrate at the moment. I know it will stop eventually, but I still just miss her, so much. I'm really trying to progress, I promise 😔
Feb 5, 2018, 4:29 PM
George Hughes
But now all we have is some malnourished woodwind :(
Feb 5, 2018, 4:28 PM
George Hughes
Ahhh, sustenance
Feb 5, 2018, 4:27 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, memes
Feb 5, 2018, 4:27 PM
George Hughes
Meme
Feb 5, 2018, 4:26 PM
George Hughes
Hahah yep
Feb 5, 2018, 4:26 PM
Callum Davies
You Vs the guy she tells you not to worry about
Feb 5, 2018, 4:26 PM
George Hughes
See thine puny school recorder to the left
Feb 5, 2018, 4:26 PM
George Hughes

Feb 5, 2018, 4:26 PM
Callum Davies
Okay
Feb 5, 2018, 4:25 PM
George Hughes
Let me find a picture
Feb 5, 2018, 4:25 PM
George Hughes
Oboe? Oh no. I promise you, the recorders back in the days were plentiful and very well fed
Feb 5, 2018, 4:25 PM
Callum Davies
Wasn't that called an oboe?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:23 PM
George Hughes
All we have now are embarrassingly little black tubes
Feb 5, 2018, 4:22 PM
George Hughes
The baroque period musicians had it right, they had giant mothrfucking monsters of recorders
Feb 5, 2018, 4:22 PM
George Hughes
See how they ran
Feb 5, 2018, 4:21 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough
Feb 5, 2018, 4:21 PM
George Hughes
And lo
Feb 5, 2018, 4:21 PM
George Hughes
You know on the third day, God created three blind mice.
Feb 5, 2018, 4:21 PM
George Hughes
So moving
Feb 5, 2018, 4:19 PM
George Hughes
So beautiful
Feb 5, 2018, 4:19 PM
George Hughes

Feb 5, 2018, 4:19 PM
George Hughes
???
Feb 5, 2018, 4:18 PM
George Hughes
Are you saying recorders aren't beautiful sounding instruments which allow us to speak the tongue of angels
Feb 5, 2018, 4:18 PM
Callum Davies
What?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:17 PM
George Hughes
You could express your sadness with a melancholy little melody on the recorder
Feb 5, 2018, 4:16 PM
Callum Davies
😂
Feb 5, 2018, 4:15 PM
George Hughes
If only it were an acting course, you could express your rage through the medium of shouting angry things to a bunch of people without them thinking "wow he is very angry"
Feb 5, 2018, 4:14 PM
Callum Davies
I'm fucking stressed out to the max! And then Julia breaks up with me during all that!? Not great timing 😂
Feb 5, 2018, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
Hahah at least you're kept busy, nothing's worse than having nothing to do
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
Callum Davies
Too much
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
Ooo goodie
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
Callum Davies
😑
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
Maybe not interesting but
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
Callum Davies
Lots
Feb 5, 2018, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
Got any interesting college coursework to do?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:11 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that's true
Feb 5, 2018, 4:10 PM
George Hughes
Trying to quantify your emotions is a little counter productive maybe?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
I know. But it's been over a week; surely I should be over her by now?
Feb 5, 2018, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry about bothering me, I'm here to help
Feb 5, 2018, 4:03 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but I don't want to bother you too much with it all
Feb 5, 2018, 4:01 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry about that haha, it might help you to speak your mind to get it off your chest
Feb 5, 2018, 4:00 PM
Callum Davies
Hi, sorry for ignoring your messages. I was just feeling really shit again, and I didn't want to seem like I was ignoring your positive advice. I just didn't wanna dampen your positive advice with my negativity
Feb 5, 2018, 3:59 PM
George Hughes
Also I really love the Beatles
Feb 5, 2018, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
It's like you were saying earlier tho, that's my subjective view, but it helps me so I like to see it like that
Feb 5, 2018, 3:31 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah 😊
Feb 5, 2018, 3:30 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I get that
Feb 5, 2018, 3:30 PM
George Hughes
Make sense?
Feb 5, 2018, 3:30 PM
George Hughes
But he says when he finds himself in very dark times, it makes him realise that he can be free from suffering through those times by just being
Feb 5, 2018, 3:28 PM
George Hughes
I can't find the words to describe how I see it
Feb 5, 2018, 3:27 PM
George Hughes
It's taken on a negative meaning I think
Feb 5, 2018, 3:26 PM
George Hughes
It's not that meaning of the phrase
Feb 5, 2018, 3:25 PM
Callum Davies
I'm trying my hardest
Feb 5, 2018, 3:25 PM
Callum Davies
I know. But it's so difficult to let it be
Feb 5, 2018, 3:24 PM
George Hughes
Hey, listen to Let it Be by John Lennon, but listen closely to the lyrics
Feb 5, 2018, 3:23 PM
George Hughes
❤️❤️
Feb 5, 2018, 2:30 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 5, 2018, 2:22 PM
George Hughes
Anytime 😊
Feb 5, 2018, 2:20 PM
Callum Davies
I get that. Thank you so much. This has really helped. 😊
Feb 5, 2018, 2:13 PM
George Hughes
I believe that exactly
Feb 5, 2018, 2:12 PM
Callum Davies
This is true. And I suppose that whilst finding someone to share in the things you love is very nice, it's not necessarily needed in order to feel happiness
Feb 5, 2018, 2:11 PM
George Hughes
The desire to be loved can hide that love
Feb 5, 2018, 2:11 PM
George Hughes
We always have love, but sometimes it's hidden from us
Feb 5, 2018, 2:10 PM
George Hughes
Love is the joy of existence, of being, of sharing, it is the joy of understanding a good joke or performing a beautiful melody
Feb 5, 2018, 2:09 PM
George Hughes
Love and being loved are two very different things I believe.
Feb 5, 2018, 2:08 PM
Callum Davies
But surely love is the best thing in the world. It's the single greatest emotion one human being can cause another to feel. A life or a world without love is a very grim one indeed
Feb 5, 2018, 2:07 PM
George Hughes
On*
Feb 5, 2018, 2:06 PM
George Hughes
They care not who or what loves them, yet they live in
Feb 5, 2018, 2:06 PM
George Hughes
Imagine being a monk with no belongings and no belonging
Feb 5, 2018, 2:05 PM
George Hughes
It means we expect constant love and we get upset when we don't get it.
Feb 5, 2018, 2:05 PM
Callum Davies
Is that not a good thing?
Feb 5, 2018, 2:04 PM
George Hughes
There's a problem with western culture that I recently discovered, it's that we are told to respect everyone.
Feb 5, 2018, 2:02 PM
Callum Davies
I'll try to keep that in mind
Feb 5, 2018, 2:01 PM
Callum Davies
That makes a great load of sense.
Feb 5, 2018, 2:00 PM
George Hughes
But what they don't realise is that the love is inside themselves all along
Feb 5, 2018, 1:58 PM
George Hughes
People create gods so that they can feel loved
Feb 5, 2018, 1:58 PM
George Hughes
You know,
Feb 5, 2018, 1:58 PM
George Hughes
Ask yourself if other people's love towards you is more important to you than your own towards you
Feb 5, 2018, 1:57 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. She'd always tell me to have more confidence; but then she'd only ever let me know when I did something wrong; kinda difficult to feel loved in that situation. But I know I need to focus on myself
Feb 5, 2018, 1:55 PM
George Hughes
Think about that
Feb 5, 2018, 1:54 PM
George Hughes
How can you love others if you can't even love yourself?
Feb 5, 2018, 1:54 PM
George Hughes
I think that's where the problem lies then
Feb 5, 2018, 1:53 PM
Callum Davies
I know. But these things are far more easily said than done. I honestly don't care about myself at this point
Feb 5, 2018, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
Don't bother with what you mean to other people by the way, bother with what you mean to yourself
Feb 5, 2018, 1:52 PM
George Hughes
You always tell me that she doesn't share her feelings, so if it matters to you how long she takes to get over it, then remember she will most likely hide her grief
Feb 5, 2018, 1:51 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I think you're right. I guess it just sucks that she seemed to have gotten over it so much more quickly than me. Like I meant nothing to her
Feb 5, 2018, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
I think you were busy worrying about what you've done wrong when in fact there was no wrong done
Feb 5, 2018, 1:49 PM
George Hughes
It's always nice in the beginning, life is like that. But then the same things happen again, secrets are revealed that you may not like. With awareness comes problems.
Feb 5, 2018, 1:48 PM
George Hughes
I don't know how she felt
Feb 5, 2018, 1:47 PM
George Hughes
No I think she was a novelty to you, even if you don't realise it
Feb 5, 2018, 1:46 PM
Callum Davies
Glad to know I was just a novelty. She never actually loved me; I just wore off then wore her down 😔
Feb 5, 2018, 1:46 PM
Callum Davies
I suppose
Feb 5, 2018, 1:45 PM
George Hughes
An addiction is good at the start but it's no good for anymore after the novelty wears off
Feb 5, 2018, 1:45 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, it doesn't matter
Feb 5, 2018, 1:44 PM
Callum Davies
But it was so great. We just clicked. It was "good at the start" apparently, but then it "just ended up being like this all the time" so my only fault was that I dared to talk about my feelings?
Feb 5, 2018, 1:43 PM
George Hughes
Maybe it's not that either of you did wrong, but perhaps you're just not right for each other
Feb 5, 2018, 1:42 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. I'm just so confused about what it is I did wrong. She was giving me so many mixed messages
Feb 5, 2018, 1:41 PM
George Hughes
There's two sides to every coin eh
Feb 5, 2018, 1:40 PM
Callum Davies
I don't like having feelings
Feb 5, 2018, 1:39 PM
Callum Davies
Goddammit
Feb 5, 2018, 1:39 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, that sucks
Feb 5, 2018, 12:31 PM
George Hughes
Awwwh I've got class til 5 today 🙄
Feb 5, 2018, 10:06 AM
Callum Davies

Feb 5, 2018, 9:56 AM
George Hughes
And keeps on turning
Feb 5, 2018, 9:55 AM
George Hughes
That's how the world turns around
Feb 5, 2018, 9:55 AM
George Hughes
😂😂
Feb 5, 2018, 9:55 AM
Callum Davies
He didn't even mean to. "Okay, I can't paint like I used to be able to because my eyesight's going. Oh, what's that, you've created an entirely new art movement based on my slightly shifted art style that I literally needed to do? Sure, why not?"
Feb 5, 2018, 9:51 AM
George Hughes
😂💁‍♂️
Feb 5, 2018, 9:49 AM
George Hughes
Huh good on Monet for being progressive
Feb 5, 2018, 9:48 AM
Callum Davies
You know Monet almost accidentally brought about the modernism movement because he was going blind. He could no longer paint in a realistic manner, and so through necessity his art style had to change
Feb 5, 2018, 9:46 AM
George Hughes
There's nowhere to go with it, apart from creating more ways to make art 💁‍♂️
Feb 5, 2018, 9:43 AM
Callum Davies
But apparently we're now moving into post post modernism movement, which is a rejection of the principles of post modernism, which itself was a rejection of the principles of modernism, so surely that's just modernism?! 😬
Feb 5, 2018, 9:42 AM
Callum Davies
This is true
Feb 5, 2018, 9:37 AM
George Hughes
I mean post modern art is inherently silly eh
Feb 5, 2018, 9:36 AM
Callum Davies
Fair enough
Feb 5, 2018, 9:36 AM
George Hughes
Silly is the highest form of art
Feb 5, 2018, 9:35 AM
Callum Davies
It's hardly high art. It's silly
Feb 5, 2018, 9:35 AM
George Hughes
<uncultured>George</uncultured>
Feb 5, 2018, 9:35 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah. It's finished now
Feb 5, 2018, 9:35 AM
George Hughes
Is that a show?
Feb 5, 2018, 9:34 AM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. My one's just from parks and recreation 😜
Feb 5, 2018, 9:33 AM
George Hughes
I guess they were just really really fed up 😂😂
Feb 5, 2018, 9:32 AM
George Hughes

Feb 5, 2018, 9:32 AM
Callum Davies
Any reason why they were doing that?
Feb 5, 2018, 9:31 AM
George Hughes
I saw a video the other week of someone completely annihilating their computer 😂 imagine I sent a gif that 💁‍♂️
Feb 5, 2018, 9:31 AM
Callum Davies

Feb 5, 2018, 9:30 AM
George Hughes
Awww damn technology ruining everything
Feb 5, 2018, 9:28 AM
Callum Davies
Not really so much in tech theatre
Feb 5, 2018, 9:27 AM
George Hughes
A bit like music or art
Feb 5, 2018, 9:26 AM
George Hughes
You'll be able to one day if you work hard 💁‍♂️ Theatre is all about sharing your personal interpretation isn't it?
Feb 5, 2018, 9:26 AM
Callum Davies
And anyway, that's only my personal interpretation of it
Feb 5, 2018, 9:17 AM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I'd love to; nobody would let me though! 😂
Feb 5, 2018, 9:16 AM
George Hughes
Being able to read into things like that is a good skill, and I imagine one that most successful directors and performers have
Feb 5, 2018, 9:15 AM
George Hughes
Why don't you direct it as an amateur production? You obviously understand it in more depth
Feb 5, 2018, 9:14 AM
Callum Davies
Well, there's almost always some production of earnest being put on somewhere or other. And yeah, I'd love to. It's just that not all productions of it are equal. It's a very silly play with a serious message. It often gets played far too seriously, in my opinion. Not enough directors realise that it's meant to be silly; it's a farce
Feb 5, 2018, 9:12 AM
George Hughes
If you ever hear of any of his plays being done in Perth or edinburger, fancy taking me out? 😎
Feb 5, 2018, 9:09 AM
Callum Davies
It's very good. I'd recommend his plays more than the book though. The importance of being earnest is better, in my opinion
Feb 5, 2018, 9:06 AM
George Hughes
Never read it 🙄
Feb 5, 2018, 9:05 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, the picture of Dorian Gray by Oscar Wilde
Feb 5, 2018, 9:03 AM
George Hughes
Does he cover it?
Feb 5, 2018, 9:03 AM
Callum Davies
I wanna see his opinion on Dorian Gray
Feb 5, 2018, 9:01 AM
George Hughes
I started reading that but I never got into it
Feb 5, 2018, 9:00 AM
Callum Davies
Fahrenheit 451 now
Feb 5, 2018, 9:00 AM
George Hughes
Yeah it's a good line isn't it
Feb 5, 2018, 8:59 AM
Callum Davies
"if I'd never seen such riches,
I could live with being poor" hmm, that really makes you think 😁
Feb 5, 2018, 8:57 AM
Callum Davies
Just on the brave new world bit
Feb 5, 2018, 8:56 AM
George Hughes
Yah that's how I came across him
Feb 5, 2018, 8:53 AM
Callum Davies
I think I might be watching the video you're talking about. Is it the PewDiePie book review video?
Feb 5, 2018, 8:49 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, of dog of wisdom lol
Feb 5, 2018, 8:43 AM
George Hughes
Still find the sound slightly annoying ;)
Feb 5, 2018, 8:38 AM
George Hughes
Hahah
Feb 5, 2018, 8:38 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, that's a good wisdom
Feb 5, 2018, 8:38 AM
George Hughes
I'm off for a shower 😛 chat soon
Feb 5, 2018, 8:37 AM
George Hughes
There's a James lyric, "if I'd never seen such riches I could live with being poor"
It's not a particularly happy lyric but it's comforting to know that others hurt along side you 😊
Feb 5, 2018, 8:37 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it did. But seeing her again also made me remember what I've lost
Feb 5, 2018, 8:35 AM
George Hughes
It's cool, I was just a little curious to hear your opinion 🙂
Aww, I hope seeing your friends at the party made you feel a little better
Feb 5, 2018, 8:35 AM
Callum Davies
I'll have a look at it soon. Sorry, currently feeling a little depressed. Yeah, still because of Julia 😕
Feb 5, 2018, 8:33 AM
George Hughes
Maybe I'm easily swayed but his arguments are compelling
Feb 5, 2018, 8:30 AM
George Hughes
Feb 5, 2018, 8:29 AM
George Hughes
I found this clip and I was intrigued
Feb 5, 2018, 8:28 AM
George Hughes
Thing is the way he argues it is very convincing because it makes complete sense.
Feb 5, 2018, 8:28 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I'm really not too sure about this guy, if I'm honest
Feb 5, 2018, 8:28 AM
George Hughes
Ugh those god damn liberals
Feb 5, 2018, 8:27 AM
George Hughes
😂😂
Feb 5, 2018, 8:27 AM
Callum Davies
Fucking leftist cucks 😂
Feb 5, 2018, 8:27 AM
George Hughes
And of course by fighting for a right to not be offended
Feb 5, 2018, 8:26 AM
George Hughes
Politics
Feb 5, 2018, 8:26 AM
George Hughes
And he believes the left wing are actually causing much more harm than good by using identity politixs
Feb 5, 2018, 8:26 AM
Callum Davies
Hmm, that's a tricky one 🤔
Feb 5, 2018, 8:25 AM
George Hughes
But he doesn't agree with the use of "pronouns"
Feb 5, 2018, 8:25 AM
George Hughes
Well he's all for free speech, and he's all for freedom of sexuality, and quite rightly
Feb 5, 2018, 8:25 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, which way? For or against? 😂
Feb 5, 2018, 8:24 AM
George Hughes
No he's an author, but he's "controversial" because he's very opinionated about the lgbt and free speech debates.
Feb 5, 2018, 8:23 AM
Callum Davies
Never heard of him. Is he a musician?
Feb 5, 2018, 8:22 AM
George Hughes
What're your thoughts on Jordan Peterson?
Feb 5, 2018, 8:18 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah?
Feb 5, 2018, 8:16 AM
George Hughes
Can I get your thoughts on something?
Feb 4, 2018, 7:30 PM
George Hughes
I'm a little worried
Feb 2, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
He's using mine right now...
Feb 2, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
Feb 2, 2018, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 2, 2018, 6:50 PM

Look what my flatmate did to his colander
Feb 2, 2018, 6:50 PM

Callum Davies

Feb 2, 2018, 6:47 PM
George Hughes
Sounds like a great time 💁🏼‍♂️
Feb 2, 2018, 6:45 PM
Callum Davies
I'll try and arrange it sometime
Feb 2, 2018, 6:44 PM
George Hughes
Also, I'd love to meet and mingle with you and Kyle's college friends at some point 😄 they sound like cool people
Feb 2, 2018, 6:44 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. Sounds like a great time 😉
Feb 2, 2018, 6:38 PM
George Hughes
Oooh I'll add you to the list, try have a big party sometime 😎
Feb 2, 2018, 6:36 PM
Callum Davies
Not that I don't like those kinds parties. If there's one nearby you know of, hit me up sometime 😉
Feb 2, 2018, 6:25 PM
George Hughes
Hahah well fairs 💁🏼‍♂️
Feb 2, 2018, 6:25 PM
Callum Davies
More of a get together, if you like
Feb 2, 2018, 6:24 PM
Callum Davies
Not that kinda party, bruh
Feb 2, 2018, 6:24 PM
Callum Davies
But this is me! 😂
Feb 2, 2018, 6:23 PM
Callum Davies
Drinks? I might get a bottle of nice wine for later on in the evening, if I feel like it
Feb 2, 2018, 6:23 PM
George Hughes
Haha make sure you flaunt it, get free drinks from everyone :p
Feb 2, 2018, 6:21 PM
Callum Davies
Pretty much, yeah! 😂
Feb 2, 2018, 6:20 PM
George Hughes
Are you driving everyone there? ;)
Feb 2, 2018, 6:19 PM
Callum Davies
I'm sure it will be. Sorry for the late reply; was busy planning getting there with other people lol
Feb 2, 2018, 6:00 PM
George Hughes
Aw right, well hope the party is good craic
Feb 2, 2018, 4:50 PM
Callum Davies
At a party tomorrow afternoon and evening, and Sunday morning for that matter.
Feb 2, 2018, 4:49 PM
George Hughes
I'll be in brig tomorrow afternoon, gig in the evening
Feb 2, 2018, 4:48 PM
Callum Davies
Okay. Sorry, really bored tonight. Seeing if anyone wants to hang out. Wanted to ask on the off chance you were in brig this weekend
Feb 2, 2018, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
Yah I am
Feb 2, 2018, 4:46 PM
Callum Davies
You're in Edinburgh, right?
Feb 2, 2018, 4:45 PM
George Hughes
Yeah of course
Feb 1, 2018, 9:18 PM
Callum Davies
Well, as much as I feel like
Feb 1, 2018, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
Have a lie in tomorrow :p
Feb 1, 2018, 9:13 PM
Callum Davies
Not really. Gonna catch up tonight lol
Feb 1, 2018, 9:12 PM
George Hughes
Did you catch any sleep?
Feb 1, 2018, 9:11 PM
Callum Davies
😂
Feb 1, 2018, 9:11 PM
George Hughes
Oh boy my favourite
Feb 1, 2018, 9:10 PM
George Hughes
Work?
Feb 1, 2018, 9:10 PM
Callum Davies
Work, basically. Very exciting!
Feb 1, 2018, 9:10 PM
George Hughes
That's great! What have you been up to today?
Feb 1, 2018, 9:09 PM
Callum Davies
Good 😁
Feb 1, 2018, 9:09 PM
George Hughes
Hey, how you doing?
Feb 1, 2018, 9:09 PM
George Hughes
Good
Feb 1, 2018, 7:23 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I'll be fine
Feb 1, 2018, 7:23 AM
George Hughes
Ah, are you gonna be driving? hope you're awake enough to be safe :P
Feb 1, 2018, 7:23 AM
Callum Davies
Not much
Feb 1, 2018, 7:22 AM
George Hughes
I guess you didn't manage to get any sleep then?
Feb 1, 2018, 7:22 AM
Callum Davies
I feel shit
Feb 1, 2018, 7:22 AM
George Hughes
❤️
Feb 1, 2018, 4:11 AM
Callum Davies

Feb 1, 2018, 4:11 AM
George Hughes
That's fine, I hope your mind is a little more at ease :) Sleep well
Feb 1, 2018, 4:10 AM
Callum Davies
Imma try to get some sleep now, if that's okay
Feb 1, 2018, 4:10 AM
Callum Davies
Hmm. I guess I never thought about it that way
Feb 1, 2018, 4:08 AM
George Hughes
And I don't doubt there's others, so yes you are needed
Feb 1, 2018, 4:08 AM
George Hughes
From my view, I don't often need to fall back on people, but I find it comforting to know I always have friends who will support me if I fall, and I believe you would :P
Feb 1, 2018, 4:07 AM
Callum Davies
Well, yes. But need me to be there for them; I don't think so
Feb 1, 2018, 4:06 AM
George Hughes
It's a big fat yes ♥
Feb 1, 2018, 4:06 AM
George Hughes
I can answer those :P
Feb 1, 2018, 4:05 AM
George Hughes
But read through those things.. aren't you loved by others? Aren't there people who need you to be there for them?
Feb 1, 2018, 4:05 AM
George Hughes
That's a good answer :)
Feb 1, 2018, 4:03 AM
Callum Davies
Is that the answer you were looking for? It's cliché and deeply unhealthy, but it's how I feel
Feb 1, 2018, 4:03 AM
Callum Davies
Because she made me feel loved, and needed, and that whatever the hardships in my life, ie college work, it would all be worth it for the idea of building a future to spend with her.
Feb 1, 2018, 4:03 AM
George Hughes
Have a think, somewhere within you there's an answer
Feb 1, 2018, 4:02 AM
Callum Davies
So am I, to be honest
Feb 1, 2018, 4:01 AM
George Hughes
wondering*
Feb 1, 2018, 4:01 AM
George Hughes
No it's not right or wrong for it to be hard, I'm wonderig why?
Feb 1, 2018, 4:01 AM
Callum Davies
I know. It shouldn't be
Feb 1, 2018, 4:00 AM
George Hughes
Why is it so hard without her?
Feb 1, 2018, 4:00 AM
Callum Davies
You know why. I don't want to have to say it and sound cliché
Feb 1, 2018, 3:58 AM
George Hughes
Go deeper, why do you feel like you hate your life right now?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:57 AM
Callum Davies
Because I hate my life! That's why! That's what it feels like!
Feb 1, 2018, 3:56 AM
George Hughes
Honestly it will help
Feb 1, 2018, 3:56 AM
George Hughes
And really consider the why, not just the idea of it
Feb 1, 2018, 3:56 AM
George Hughes
Try and look behind that and ask why it's telling you to do those things?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:56 AM
Callum Davies
My brain is NOT telling me to do very good things at the moment
Feb 1, 2018, 3:54 AM
George Hughes
Try and understand what your brain is trying to tell you
Feb 1, 2018, 3:53 AM
George Hughes
Well instead of trying to block them out, why don't you just sit and think for half an hour
Feb 1, 2018, 3:53 AM
Callum Davies
I can't fucking do that! I can't put thoughts to the side
Feb 1, 2018, 3:52 AM
George Hughes
Try meditation for a little while, just let everything be, don't even try to sleep, just be for a while
Feb 1, 2018, 3:51 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah 😕
Feb 1, 2018, 3:50 AM
George Hughes
Although I guess the insomnia isn't helping
Feb 1, 2018, 3:50 AM
George Hughes
You'll be better talking to her after a good night's sleep
Feb 1, 2018, 3:50 AM
Callum Davies
Plus I wanna fucking talk to Julia
Feb 1, 2018, 3:49 AM
Callum Davies
I've got maybe 2 hours until I can grab some food, and I'm starving. I've got no minutes left, limited data and nobody's up
Feb 1, 2018, 3:48 AM
George Hughes
Like trying to solve a thousand piece puzzle without looking at the pieces
Feb 1, 2018, 3:47 AM
George Hughes
No use trying to analyse it when it's in your head
Feb 1, 2018, 3:47 AM
George Hughes
Just write your stream of consciousness as it comes into your head, then analyse it
Feb 1, 2018, 3:47 AM
George Hughes
I find it useful to do mind vomit sometimes
Feb 1, 2018, 3:46 AM
Callum Davies
Meh, I dunno what they are to be honest
Feb 1, 2018, 3:45 AM
George Hughes
Wanna share any?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:45 AM
Callum Davies
Sorry, there's so many thoughts going through my head 😵
Feb 1, 2018, 3:45 AM
George Hughes

Feb 1, 2018, 3:44 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah.
Feb 1, 2018, 3:44 AM
George Hughes
Much prefer countdown
Feb 1, 2018, 3:44 AM
George Hughes
It's a difficult show tho
Feb 1, 2018, 3:44 AM
Callum Davies
I dunno. I'm so-so
Feb 1, 2018, 3:43 AM
George Hughes
Huh, my mum is pretty good at it but I'm atrociously bad at seeing the pattern
Feb 1, 2018, 3:43 AM
Callum Davies
A little bit
Feb 1, 2018, 3:42 AM
George Hughes
Have you watched much of it?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:42 AM
Callum Davies
I know what it is
Feb 1, 2018, 3:42 AM
George Hughes
Watch it sometime, it's good
Feb 1, 2018, 3:42 AM
George Hughes
It's a tv show where you have to find the link between seemingly unrelated things
Feb 1, 2018, 3:41 AM
Callum Davies
Maybe 💁🏻
Feb 1, 2018, 3:41 AM
George Hughes
I think
Feb 1, 2018, 3:40 AM
George Hughes
You'd be good at Only Connect
Feb 1, 2018, 3:40 AM
George Hughes
Lmao
Feb 1, 2018, 3:40 AM
Callum Davies
No, they did "Don't You Forget About Me" 😂
Feb 1, 2018, 3:40 AM
George Hughes
Too subtle for my simple mind 😁
Feb 1, 2018, 3:39 AM
Callum Davies
I was meaning the D-Ream song "Things Can Only Get Better"; and band for which Professor Brian Cox was the keyboard player
Feb 1, 2018, 3:39 AM
George Hughes
Boom, maths has just solved your predicament ;)
Feb 1, 2018, 3:37 AM
George Hughes
Well if you want the maths, if you're feeling really low, there's not much lower to go so probability suggests improvement
Feb 1, 2018, 3:37 AM
Callum Davies
😂
Feb 1, 2018, 3:36 AM
Callum Davies
Alright Brian Cox
Feb 1, 2018, 3:36 AM
George Hughes
Odds are it's uphill from there tho
Feb 1, 2018, 3:36 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah. Life is good at the moment😒
Feb 1, 2018, 3:35 AM
George Hughes
Ahh, can hardly blame you
Feb 1, 2018, 3:35 AM
Callum Davies
Nope. Been falling behind with work because I can't concentrate right now
Feb 1, 2018, 3:34 AM
George Hughes
Oh xD Been skipping classes?? :O
Feb 1, 2018, 3:33 AM
Callum Davies
Nope😁
Feb 1, 2018, 3:32 AM
George Hughes
Is college going well?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:32 AM
George Hughes
Huh fair, a small village in the middle of the countryside will help with that
Feb 1, 2018, 3:32 AM
Callum Davies
Because I needed to get away
Feb 1, 2018, 3:31 AM
Callum Davies
Dunkeld
Feb 1, 2018, 3:31 AM
George Hughes
and why? :P
Feb 1, 2018, 3:31 AM
George Hughes
Whereabouts?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:31 AM
George Hughes
Oooo very fancy
Feb 1, 2018, 3:31 AM
Callum Davies
Stress induced insomnia in a dingy hotel room 👍🏻
Feb 1, 2018, 3:30 AM
George Hughes
What're you doing up at this unholy time?
Feb 1, 2018, 3:29 AM
George Hughes
Heyo :D
Feb 1, 2018, 3:29 AM
Callum Davies

Jan 28, 2018, 5:59 PM
Callum Davies

Jan 28, 2018, 5:58 PM
George Hughes
Never mind anyways, just needed to make sure you knew there's no bad intentions 😝
Jan 28, 2018, 5:58 PM
George Hughes
Nah I meant for like what you were saying earlier about it taking two people to fall out
Jan 28, 2018, 5:57 PM
Callum Davies
😒 Okay, that wasn't very cool
Jan 28, 2018, 5:56 PM
George Hughes
How fitting 😆
Jan 28, 2018, 5:56 PM
Callum Davies
Faults on both sides 😂
Jan 28, 2018, 5:56 PM
George Hughes
Nah that was my bad haha
Jan 28, 2018, 5:55 PM
Callum Davies
Oh that. Yeah, sorry about that 😳
Jan 28, 2018, 5:55 PM
George Hughes
My excuse is I'm hungover 😇
Jan 28, 2018, 5:55 PM
George Hughes
Just that I was giving bad advice and you didn't respond well
Jan 28, 2018, 5:55 PM
George Hughes
Hope all goes well, you know best what to do 😁
Jan 28, 2018, 5:54 PM
Callum Davies
No, you didn't. Why would you think that?
Jan 28, 2018, 5:54 PM
George Hughes
Sorry if I upset you earlier 🤔
Jan 28, 2018, 5:54 PM
Callum Davies
The Karoom called you.
Duration: 5 minutes
Jan 28, 2018, 2:07 PM
Callum Davies
2 mins
Jan 28, 2018, 1:59 PM
George Hughes
Sure
Jan 28, 2018, 1:59 PM
Callum Davies
Sure. Not a problem. Hey let's call. It's easier
Jan 28, 2018, 1:58 PM
George Hughes
Actually, hope you don't mind, I've got equipment with me, is that okay?
Jan 28, 2018, 1:57 PM
George Hughes
Sure I still need to breakfast and stuff
Jan 28, 2018, 1:57 PM
George Hughes
Yeah we could have a wander in town then 😁
Jan 28, 2018, 1:57 PM
Callum Davies
I'll take you into town if you want. Give me some time to get dressed, then I'll pick you up?
Jan 28, 2018, 1:56 PM
George Hughes
Last bus is 5:45 so probs then
Jan 28, 2018, 1:55 PM
George Hughes
Not sure, but I'll need to go into town cause bus doesn't go through brig anymore lol
Jan 28, 2018, 1:55 PM
Callum Davies
What time you going back to Edinburgh?
Jan 28, 2018, 1:54 PM
George Hughes
Could do for a wee bit yeah 😁
Jan 28, 2018, 1:54 PM
Callum Davies
Just wondering if you wanted to hang out today?
Jan 28, 2018, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, need to head back to Edinburgh soon tho. What were you thinking?
Jan 28, 2018, 1:53 PM
Callum Davies
Are you in brig at the moment?
Jan 28, 2018, 12:49 PM
George Hughes
You're not being difficult, you're just down :/
Jan 27, 2018, 12:48 PM
Callum Davies
Sorry, I don't mean to be difficult. I know you're just trying to help
Jan 27, 2018, 12:46 PM
Callum Davies
😒
Jan 27, 2018, 12:26 AM
George Hughes
Boys and girls may go away but memes will always show me de way
Jan 26, 2018, 10:45 PM
George Hughes
Hahah that's my man
Jan 26, 2018, 10:44 PM
Callum Davies
Already done that lol
Jan 26, 2018, 10:43 PM
George Hughes
I'm always here 😊 Also, a big dose of memes might be more suitable 😛
Jan 26, 2018, 10:43 PM
Callum Davies
I don't think I trust myself with the latter lol but thanks for the support. I'll hit you up sometime. Thanks buddy, I really appreciate it😊
Jan 26, 2018, 8:40 PM
George Hughes
Oh 😕 hope you're coping okay, if you need to drown your sorrows in a pint and speak your mind sometime, let me know 🙂
Jan 26, 2018, 8:39 PM
Callum Davies
Hi, sorry. I've just been really emotional lately; didn't always feel like talking. Yeah, Julia and I broke up
Jan 26, 2018, 8:10 PM
George Hughes
Hey how you doing?
Jan 26, 2018, 4:48 PM
George Hughes
Aw right, it's nothing bad is it?
Jan 25, 2018, 10:50 PM
Callum Davies
Can't say
Jan 25, 2018, 10:47 PM
George Hughes
Oh 😞 how come?
Jan 25, 2018, 10:46 PM
Callum Davies
Nope. Sorry. Nope. Birthday is cancelled
Jan 25, 2018, 10:43 PM
George Hughes
Awww I try ❤️
Jan 25, 2018, 10:21 AM
Callum Davies
Cheers. You great 👍🏻
Jan 25, 2018, 10:21 AM
George Hughes
That's fine, I won't make any plans meanwhile :p
Jan 25, 2018, 10:21 AM
Callum Davies
Hi, I'm in two minds about Feb 11th, just saying. I'll let you know when I've come to a firm decision 😉
Jan 25, 2018, 10:17 AM
George Hughes
Okieee
Jan 24, 2018, 1:17 PM
Callum Davies
Dunno yet
Jan 24, 2018, 1:17 PM
George Hughes
What time on Sunday then?
Jan 24, 2018, 1:17 PM
Callum Davies
Nice 😉
Jan 24, 2018, 1:16 PM
George Hughes

Jan 24, 2018, 1:16 PM
George Hughes
Ayyy very nice 😂
Jan 24, 2018, 1:16 PM
Callum Davies
Late as in the late Dent Arthur Dent. It's a sort of threat, you see. I've never been very good at them myself, but I'm told they can be terribly effective
Jan 24, 2018, 1:15 PM
George Hughes
Pretty much 😂
Jan 24, 2018, 1:14 PM
Callum Davies
And you'll still be late! 😂
Jan 24, 2018, 1:14 PM
George Hughes
Bro I'll be the singer at my own funeral
Jan 24, 2018, 1:14 PM
Callum Davies
Just make sure your voice and arms work, and you could be dead for all I care lol
Jan 24, 2018, 1:13 PM
George Hughes
I'll probably wake up like 1ish 😂 but I can get up a little earlier if you need
Jan 24, 2018, 1:13 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, the afternoon is what I'm thinking
Jan 24, 2018, 1:12 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha it'd be fun, depends when cause I'll be hungover af, and you'd need to pick me up from Edinburgh if you were doing that. But if that's all cool, then sure
Jan 24, 2018, 1:11 PM
Callum Davies
Plus free transport, mind you
Jan 24, 2018, 1:11 PM
Callum Davies
Also, £25 an hour!? You're having a laugh right? I'll do £10
Jan 24, 2018, 1:10 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but it's me who did it. I can't do it, because I can't play or sing lol. I'll still do my verse lol, because she actually likes that for some reason. I'll not stay for a while though. From what I hear, it's a pretty busy day for her that day. Always leave them wanting more 😉
Jan 24, 2018, 1:10 PM
George Hughes
Ah I see what you did there
Jan 24, 2018, 1:09 PM
George Hughes
Hahah I feel like that'd be kinds weird tho cause then it's me singing to her 😂
Jan 24, 2018, 1:09 PM
Callum Davies
The 11th is Julia's birthday. She doesn't know I'm doing anything for her. I want to surprise her. She loved the song we made for her. We go up to Aberfeldy on the 11th. We drive up to her doorstep, or wherever she is 😂 Live performance of the most romantic thing I've ever done for her!
Jan 24, 2018, 1:07 PM
George Hughes
Hahah well it's £25 an hour I guess but transport on Sunday is tricky, what's your idea? 😂
Jan 24, 2018, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies
How much do you charge to be hired? I've got an idea!
Jan 24, 2018, 1:05 PM
George Hughes
Possibly, have mates coming over the night before for a mad one, how come?
Jan 24, 2018, 1:05 PM
Callum Davies
Are you free on the 11th Feb?
Jan 24, 2018, 9:42 AM
George Hughes
Heyo
Jan 18, 2018, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
I usually can't guarantee how many days it'll take for me to reply 💁‍♂️
Jan 12, 2018, 10:25 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. I'll probably be going to bed soon, but let me know what you think of him. I just can't guarantee that I'll reply today lol😂
Jan 12, 2018, 9:51 PM
George Hughes
😁
Jan 12, 2018, 9:50 PM
George Hughes
I'll take a look once we've washed the dishes
Jan 12, 2018, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
Just type "Louis CK" into YouTube. I couldn't recommend any one. They're all so good 😁
Jan 12, 2018, 9:48 PM
George Hughes
Got any clips?
Jan 12, 2018, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
He's very funny
Jan 12, 2018, 9:47 PM
George Hughes
I'm not too familiar with him to be honest
Jan 12, 2018, 9:47 PM
Callum Davies
He does deadpan very very well
Jan 12, 2018, 7:16 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. Like Louis C.K.
Jan 12, 2018, 7:16 PM
George Hughes
The best jokes are the ones that sound like they're told seriously a mon avis ;)
Jan 12, 2018, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
I kinda thought it was a joke, but I didn't want to assume lol. It's cool 😉
Jan 12, 2018, 7:14 PM
George Hughes
💁‍♂️💁‍♂️
Jan 12, 2018, 7:13 PM
George Hughes
Well I'm not the kind of person that would intrude on her meeting your fam, and the joke was if they're so cool, then why haven't I met them, maybe I worded it wrong
Jan 12, 2018, 7:13 PM
Callum Davies
Put a 'lol' or a laughing face or something. Else, how would I know? Think about it 😁
Jan 12, 2018, 7:12 PM
George Hughes
Too subtle eh?
Jan 12, 2018, 7:11 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. You didn't give any indication, so I didn't know
Jan 12, 2018, 7:11 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha I was kidding bro 😆
Jan 12, 2018, 7:11 PM
Callum Davies
She just wants to meet my family. She kinda like "your family is cool. I'd like to meet more of them" and not with Julia, no offense but you might kinda change the dynamic lol. And I'm kinda busy Sunday as well lol, so it looks unlikely. I feel really bad now
Jan 12, 2018, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
Can I meet them?
Jan 12, 2018, 7:08 PM
George Hughes
Fairs 💁‍♂️ what's so cool about your cousin that she wants to meet them? ;)
Jan 12, 2018, 7:08 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, well we were going to go for dinner, but it turns out we're staying in now. Point is that Julia wants to meet my cousin, the venue doesn't really matter. Plus, it's a lot more chill this way😎
Jan 12, 2018, 7:07 PM
George Hughes
Where you going for dinner?
Jan 12, 2018, 7:06 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
Jan 12, 2018, 7:05 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I've no delusions. I'm resigned to the fact that it's not happening this weekend😅
Jan 12, 2018, 7:04 PM
George Hughes
Good luck getting anything done then 😂
Jan 12, 2018, 7:04 PM
Callum Davies
I was gonna and try to get some work done this weekend as well! That's not happening now 😂
Jan 12, 2018, 7:03 PM
George Hughes
Hahah you a playah
Jan 12, 2018, 7:03 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, meeting up with Julia for dinner with a cousin who's coming up from England. You're actually the second person who's asked me that today. I'm inexplicably popular this weekend 😂
Jan 12, 2018, 7:02 PM
George Hughes
You up to anything tomorrow morning?
Jan 12, 2018, 7:01 PM
George Hughes
😎😎
Jan 12, 2018, 7:00 PM
Callum Davies
This is a fair point 💁🏻
Jan 12, 2018, 6:59 PM
George Hughes
No bother bro
Jan 12, 2018, 6:59 PM
George Hughes
Well you don't "need" to be, you just want to be for whatever reason 💁‍♂️
Jan 12, 2018, 6:58 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers for letting me know that he'd released a new work 😉
Jan 12, 2018, 6:58 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that's just a reminder to myself when I open up my phone. I'm not that chill. So, I need to be more chill lol 😂
Jan 12, 2018, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
That background will help you be more chill ;)
Jan 12, 2018, 6:56 PM
Callum Davies

Jan 12, 2018, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough 😂
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I do but I couldn't remember if I'd mentioned the name
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Nor do I, but if he posts it usually catches my eye
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
It was actually you who introduced me to him. Don't you remember?
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Hahah
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
And yeah, I'm aware of his work. I just don't follow him religiously
Jan 12, 2018, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
On his Facebook page, think he has tapestries and prints on his website
Jan 12, 2018, 6:49 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. Is it on his website
Jan 12, 2018, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Simon Haiduk, you should follow him
Jan 12, 2018, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
The artist just posted it today
Jan 12, 2018, 6:49 PM
Callum Davies
It's beautiful. Is it a new one or something?
Jan 12, 2018, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
Cool new phone background if you want it
Jan 12, 2018, 6:47 PM
George Hughes

Jan 12, 2018, 6:47 PM
George Hughes
I usually am 😛
Jan 11, 2018, 4:54 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. I know. You're probably right
Jan 11, 2018, 4:53 PM
George Hughes
It worked out fine last time :) don't let yourself worry

Nah. It's just that Julia's going through some stuff at the moment, I think. But she won't tell me what, because she's kinda that type of person. She likes to sort stuff out by herself. So I'm giving her the space she needs at the moment, but I'm just worried is all, naturally
Jan 11, 2018, 4:52 PM
George Hughes
Want to chat about it?
Jan 11, 2018, 4:50 PM
Callum Davies
Lol
Jan 11, 2018, 4:50 PM
Callum Davies
Doesn't matter to you. Not your problem loo
Jan 11, 2018, 4:50 PM
George Hughes
What's up??
Jan 11, 2018, 4:49 PM
Callum Davies
Not too well, if I'm honest
Jan 11, 2018, 4:49 PM
George Hughes
Very bien danké, et toi?
Jan 11, 2018, 4:48 PM
Callum Davies
How are you doing?
Jan 11, 2018, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
Heyoooo
Jan 11, 2018, 4:46 PM
Callum Davies
Hi
Jan 11, 2018, 4:45 PM
George Hughes
Eet's cool, catch you later bruh 😎
Jan 10, 2018, 4:18 PM
Callum Davies
Sorry to just dart off like this
Jan 10, 2018, 4:18 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway. I'm gonna head off, because mum's just called me for something. See ya later 😉
Jan 10, 2018, 4:18 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha
Jan 10, 2018, 4:17 PM
Callum Davies
...a ball of string, and 3 sticks of dynamite, officer
Jan 10, 2018, 4:17 PM
George Hughes
I have a theory as to why the police actually came though, and it involves a depressed debenhams employee
Jan 10, 2018, 4:16 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I see. Perhaps not then
Jan 10, 2018, 4:15 PM
George Hughes
Nah cause Edinburgh has laws that say no amplification, it's just that they haven't advertised them until recently
Jan 10, 2018, 4:15 PM
Callum Davies
That's ridiculous. Do it, if you do, demand that it be taken to a magistrate court. It's your legal right to be able to challenge fines. When you tell them what's up, any magistrate would dismiss the case
Jan 10, 2018, 4:14 PM
George Hughes
To be fair.. I think I was playing a little loud, but I didn't have my hearing aids in so I didn't notice lol
Jan 10, 2018, 4:14 PM
George Hughes
If I busk with an amp again, I get fined
Jan 10, 2018, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
I got a wee yellow note
Jan 10, 2018, 4:13 PM
Callum Davies
Ohh? Anti social behaviour!? 😂 You didn't get an ASBO, did you?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
Folk dancing and singing along, coming up and thanking me, saying how nice a voice I have: "Anti-social behaviour"
Jan 10, 2018, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
"Anti-social behaviour"
Jan 10, 2018, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
It was about busking
Jan 10, 2018, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
Hahah nahhh I'm not doing that anymore
Jan 10, 2018, 4:12 PM
Callum Davies
Well, more specifically, illegal drugs 😂
Jan 10, 2018, 4:11 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, Christ! I didn't mean that! I wasn't thinking they were gonna come an make me disappear! 😂 So what was it about? And you didn't have any drugs on you at the time, did you?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:11 PM
George Hughes
Fortunately we don't live in China so no :P
Jan 10, 2018, 4:10 PM
Callum Davies
Was it because someone you knew was driving with a headlight out?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:10 PM
George Hughes
Did I tell you I got spoken to by the police the other day?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:09 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, well we've put down a rag below it for the night, then we can work out what's going to need doing, if anything at all
Jan 10, 2018, 4:09 PM
George Hughes
ayyyy hahah although that's not good, will Scotty boy fix that for ya?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:08 PM
Callum Davies
Plus, it's been dripping a liquid that we can't determine whether it's oil or just dirty water. Either I've got an oil leak, or just a dirty undercarriage. Like father, like son, eh? 😉
Jan 10, 2018, 4:06 PM
George Hughes
stressful :(
Jan 10, 2018, 4:04 PM
Callum Davies
I need it. I've been shouting at my car all day to GET THIS FUCKING HEADLIGHT OUT YOU PIECE OF SHIT!!!
Jan 10, 2018, 4:03 PM
George Hughes
:P
Jan 10, 2018, 4:03 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, it's cool. It made me laugh
Jan 10, 2018, 4:03 PM
George Hughes
Hahah just couldn't resist *dropping* that one in
Jan 10, 2018, 4:02 PM
Callum Davies
I was assuming you meant pre-tumble!
Jan 10, 2018, 4:02 PM
George Hughes
♥
Jan 10, 2018, 4:01 PM
George Hughes
Turns out that refraining from letting it land on the floor makes it sound much clearer ;)
Jan 10, 2018, 4:01 PM
Callum Davies
Surely it's the exact same thing?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:00 PM
Callum Davies
Oh? Why's that?
Jan 10, 2018, 4:00 PM
George Hughes
It works much better than the old one did ;)
Jan 10, 2018, 4:00 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha
Jan 10, 2018, 3:59 PM
Callum Davies
Talking of, how's the new C-1?
Jan 10, 2018, 3:59 PM
George Hughes
I'll bear that in mind but I'll aim to make them see it as a favour to both parties and therefore no cost
Jan 10, 2018, 3:59 PM
Callum Davies
No, but seriously. Because my limit would probably be like £200, absolute max!
Jan 10, 2018, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
Nah not a clue, I'll ask folk and see who's interested, I'm sure there's a few folk out there looking for ideas
Jan 10, 2018, 3:58 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, probably accurate
Jan 10, 2018, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
About 7, considering the students have to actually get out of bed to do any of the project :P
Jan 10, 2018, 3:58 PM
Callum Davies
And when we say money, how much are we talking? Like, triple figures? Oh god, not 4 figures? 5!? 😮
Jan 10, 2018, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
Hahah not a chance xD It's easy to finish a single person project in a couple days, but as soon as you start adding multiple students, it'll probably take quite some time to get anywhere hah
Jan 10, 2018, 3:56 PM
Callum Davies
*by
Jan 10, 2018, 3:55 PM
Callum Davies
Could it be done my February 11th, do you think? I know it's a big ask, but that's her birthday lol 😂
Jan 10, 2018, 3:55 PM
George Hughes
Wouldn't rush into making presents even more difficult xD But I'll ask around and see if folk are interested
Jan 10, 2018, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
What if, we say they could use it for their portfolios?
Jan 10, 2018, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, I'll.see
Jan 10, 2018, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
Let's do it
Jan 10, 2018, 3:54 PM
George Hughes
Hahahah well I'll see but there'll probably be money in it this time xD Media students are very busy... although I'm sure you could sell the resulting organs on the black market to make up for it :D
Jan 10, 2018, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
Just horrific, horrific images
Jan 10, 2018, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
Blood, guts, everywhere
Jan 10, 2018, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
Just 🎆 on the spot
Jan 10, 2018, 3:52 PM
Callum Davies
She'd actually just explode
Jan 10, 2018, 3:52 PM
Callum Davies
You're fucking joking!? No way! That'd be crazy
Jan 10, 2018, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
I know a few people who could get a music video produced... that'd be a step up :P
Jan 10, 2018, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
Like, if any present I give her now is any less than an original song written about and for her, she'll be disappointed😂
Jan 10, 2018, 3:51 PM
George Hughes
is that so? xD
Jan 10, 2018, 3:50 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, by the way, Julia says that I've now set a very high bar for myself
Jan 10, 2018, 3:50 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. But I feel like I'll be busy with work this weekend. But we'll see what happens
Jan 10, 2018, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
he'll be back at the weekend eh
Jan 10, 2018, 3:49 PM
George Hughes
eww don't want him in my city
Jan 10, 2018, 3:49 PM
Callum Davies
Some fuckboi came over a few weeks ago, but word is he's back in Edinburgh now
Jan 10, 2018, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
oh shit hahah
Jan 10, 2018, 3:48 PM
Callum Davies
And I dunno
Jan 10, 2018, 3:47 PM
Callum Davies
I noticed just before circus skills yesterday though, which starts at 7:15pm, so that meant I was driving in the dark yesterday with a headlight out! Was shitting myself 😂
Jan 10, 2018, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
what's been happening
Jan 10, 2018, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
Any good Perth gossip?
Jan 10, 2018, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
Niceeee
Jan 10, 2018, 3:47 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, I dunno. Anyway, took it to Scott (my mechanic; that's right, I have a guy) to help me fit it, because I've never done it on a yaris before and they have weird fittings, but it's all nice and road legal now
Jan 10, 2018, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha damn xD
Jan 10, 2018, 3:45 PM
Callum Davies
Oh god, that might genuinely have been what did it 😂
Jan 10, 2018, 3:45 PM
George Hughes
you need to leave the poor sheep alone xD
Jan 10, 2018, 3:44 PM
Callum Davies
But mainly the new stereo😁
Jan 10, 2018, 3:44 PM
Callum Davies
(Also have a new headlight because the left one blew)
Jan 10, 2018, 3:44 PM

You'll be spending even more time in that car :P
Jan 10, 2018, 3:43 PM

Bluetooth music playing and phoning, dab radio, aux, CD player. The works
Jan 10, 2018, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
*feels bad about dabbing*
Jan 10, 2018, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
*dabs*
Jan 10, 2018, 3:43 PM
Callum Davies
Got DAB radio as well
Jan 10, 2018, 3:42 PM
George Hughes
Hahah oops I forgot it's 2018
Jan 10, 2018, 3:42 PM
Callum Davies
Aux? It all about Bluetooth today, Grandad
Jan 10, 2018, 3:42 PM
George Hughes
Niceee, CD and aux? :P
Jan 10, 2018, 3:41 PM

Callum Davies
Thanks
Jan 8, 2018, 8:41 AM
George Hughes
I'll sing to the stars oh
Wherever you are
I'll come to your doorstep
And stop for a while
Just to bask in your empathy
Share in our destiny
Look at the sky and
Forever we'll fly

Wait for a moment and
Spread our delight at the
Heavenly sights of the
North and the blades of the
Grass on the hills, the
Wind and the thrill of the
Hills and the marshes
Dividing the lakes

We stroll and we run through the
Blossoming trees and the
Birds and the bees will be
Humming today
And we say that we'll wait here
A million years while we
Share in our fears as we
Wonder our fate

I wandered further to
See what would lie there
And I stood amazed at the
Wonders I saw
But when you fall behind me
I trust that you'll understand
I'll be your helping hand
All will be braw

Every moment I'm breathing without you I'm
Broken and helpless through
All the next day when I
Think to behind when we
Smiled and we tried to make
Last all the time til I
Rode on my way

A venturous harlequin
Hair fiery red the
First time I met her
Doubt finally fled
She may never need me but
I'll always need her just
Singing how lucky I
Am to the birds
Jan 7, 2018, 10:54 PM
Callum Davies
Hey man, Julia's asking for the lyrics to the song. You couldn't send them in a message, could you? Thanks 😉
Jan 7, 2018, 9:41 PM
George Hughes
How're you doing?
Jan 3, 2018, 2:43 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, it's cool. Glad it arrived 😉
Jan 3, 2018, 2:39 PM
George Hughes
Hi Callum, the mic came today, thanks for that :) hope it's not been bothering you at all haha, do you still want the old one?
Jan 3, 2018, 1:56 PM

That's okay
Jan 1, 2018, 9:25 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but I'm afraid I can't talk right now. Sorry
Jan 1, 2018, 9:24 PM
George Hughes
I guess she liked it then?😝
Jan 1, 2018, 9:23 PM
George Hughes
Hahahah
Jan 1, 2018, 4:39 PM

The Karoom set your nickname to Music Maestro.
Jan 1, 2018, 4:32 PM
George Hughes
Hope you have a good year 😁
Jan 1, 2018, 1:18 PM
Callum Davies
She hasn't heard it yet. I told her to listen to it today. She'll listen to it this afternoon
Jan 1, 2018, 11:43 AM
George Hughes
Happy new year bro ❤️ hope the song went down well ;)
Jan 1, 2018, 2:15 AM
George Hughes
Thanks very much for the drinks 😋 what's a CD player? Is that one of those floppy disk era things that done existed?
Dec 30, 2017, 10:37 PM
Callum Davies
Thanks once again for all your help with the song. Julia's really interesting as to what our "project" (as I've been calling it) is; I can't wait to present it to her! 😄 Again, enjoy your peronis, you've definitely earned them. I gave it a listen on the ol' cd player (because I still own one of those!) and it's sounding great.
Dec 30, 2017, 9:18 PM
George Hughes
Yeah easily done 😁
Dec 29, 2017, 11:07 PM
Callum Davies
Kinda wanna say different things😝
Dec 29, 2017, 9:46 PM
Callum Davies
Hi, is there any chance of rerecording the intro tomorrow?
Dec 29, 2017, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Oh no I will die
Dec 29, 2017, 7:39 PM
Callum Davies
I'll be round at 6 tomorrow morning then
Dec 29, 2017, 7:33 PM
George Hughes
Nahhhh all I need is a wake up yell, especially directly into my ear
Dec 29, 2017, 7:33 PM
Callum Davies
Well I'll motivate you tomorrow. Warming up my slapping hand ✋🏻
Dec 29, 2017, 7:32 PM
George Hughes
Just need the inspiration and the motivation 💁‍♂️
Dec 29, 2017, 7:31 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that's all you 😁
Dec 29, 2017, 7:30 PM
George Hughes
Yeah bro, it's sounding gooood
Dec 29, 2017, 7:29 PM
Callum Davies
Looking forward to finishing off the song tomorrow 😉
Dec 29, 2017, 7:29 PM
Callum Davies
The Karoom set your nickname to Bike Cuck.
Dec 29, 2017, 4:45 PM
Callum Davies
Where you at?
Dec 28, 2017, 8:42 PM
George Hughes
Sweeet
Dec 28, 2017, 7:51 PM
Callum Davies
Okay. Yup
Dec 28, 2017, 7:51 PM
George Hughes
Would you e able to pick me up?
Dec 28, 2017, 7:51 PM
George Hughes
Dinner is still in the making, I'll let you know when it's done
Dec 28, 2017, 7:50 PM
Callum Davies
How you looking?
Dec 28, 2017, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
See yaa
Dec 28, 2017, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, see you then
Dec 28, 2017, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
I'll let you know when dinner is due then, might be about 8ish
Dec 28, 2017, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
Exciting
Dec 28, 2017, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
Oooo
Dec 28, 2017, 6:31 PM
Callum Davies
IE we have lots of alcohol here!
Dec 28, 2017, 6:31 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, or Christmas has just happened
Dec 28, 2017, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
We could go to the pub if I'm staying over?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:30 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I might do actually, that'd be fun
Dec 28, 2017, 6:30 PM
Callum Davies
You can stay over if you want. It'd be no trouble getting the air bed out. Since you're coming round tomorrow anyway. 😂
Dec 28, 2017, 6:28 PM
George Hughes
For sure bro
Dec 28, 2017, 6:27 PM
Callum Davies
Wanna hang out?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:27 PM
George Hughes
After dinner yeah 💁‍♂️
Dec 28, 2017, 6:27 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck it. Are you free tonight?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:27 PM
Callum Davies
😂
Dec 28, 2017, 6:26 PM
George Hughes
Same 😆 I did need then tbf 😂
Dec 28, 2017, 6:25 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, yeah. And socks! 😂
Dec 28, 2017, 6:25 PM
George Hughes
Any socks?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:25 PM
Callum Davies
Nothing much, a few books, that sort of stuff
Dec 28, 2017, 6:24 PM
George Hughes
Either way, you'll know the answer 💁‍♂️ what did you get?
Dec 28, 2017, 6:24 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, if it happens! 😂 I'm fully expecting her to just see it and ignore it. And yeah, I suppose.
Dec 28, 2017, 6:21 PM
George Hughes
Did you enjoy your Christmas btw??
Dec 28, 2017, 6:21 PM
George Hughes
It'll be good to hear it from her side :)
Dec 28, 2017, 6:20 PM
Callum Davies
I've sent Julia a message asking how she is and if she needs space or wants to talk. Because quite honestly I don't know what to do, so I just asked Julia.
Dec 28, 2017, 6:19 PM
George Hughes
Had any more advice? :p
Dec 28, 2017, 6:18 PM
Callum Davies
They're good.
Dec 28, 2017, 6:17 PM
George Hughes
How's Jasper? I still haven't met them
Dec 28, 2017, 6:17 PM
Callum Davies

Dec 28, 2017, 6:16 PM

❤️❤️
Dec 28, 2017, 4:07 PM
Callum Davies
I won't. Thanks for the help, buddy 😊
Dec 28, 2017, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
And remember, don't worry ;)
Dec 28, 2017, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
Okieee chat soon then
Dec 28, 2017, 4:07 PM
Callum Davies
But I gotta go now. Jasper's messaging me. Speak soon?
Dec 28, 2017, 4:06 PM
George Hughes
Class 😁
Dec 28, 2017, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
But I'm still down for tomorrow hanging out
Dec 28, 2017, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
I suppose so. But for now, I think I'll give her space
Dec 28, 2017, 4:06 PM
George Hughes
It's easy to seem like the level headed one
Dec 28, 2017, 4:05 PM
Callum Davies
Really? She's always been the level headed one, to be honest
Dec 28, 2017, 4:04 PM
George Hughes
And listen, girls are more hormonal than guys, so anything she feels is going to be naturally amplified
Dec 28, 2017, 4:04 PM
Callum Davies
Maybe. Listen, I know I'm not blameless, but it did seem like a large reaction to what should have been just a little tiff, if that. Like, we've gone through a lot worse in the past
Dec 28, 2017, 4:04 PM
George Hughes
And the best thing to help her clear her head so she can see that it's not your burden is a little time
Dec 28, 2017, 4:03 PM
George Hughes
Maybe she just can't see that though
Dec 28, 2017, 4:03 PM
George Hughes
If that's so, then the disagreements she is having at home right now must be making it harder for her to accept help because she doesn't want to feel any worse?
Dec 28, 2017, 4:03 PM
Callum Davies
Yes. But I try to tell her, it's not burden whatsoever, and that I'd do far greater than that just to see her
Dec 28, 2017, 4:02 PM
George Hughes
So she's been brought up to fend for herself and now she feels extremely guilty accepting any help?
Dec 28, 2017, 4:02 PM
Callum Davies
Because of her parents. Basically, from what I can tell, basically all of her insecurities can be traced back to her parents. I dunno, maybe they taught her not to rely on anyone, but she's taken that to an extreme?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
Then you can look at the situation as Kyle might look at it, "objectively"
Dec 28, 2017, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
And writing your thoughts down will help you analyse them
Dec 28, 2017, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
But why is she so independent, there has to be an underlying reason
Dec 28, 2017, 3:57 PM
Callum Davies
It's not about going out. She loves going out. She's just fiercely independent.
Dec 28, 2017, 3:56 PM
George Hughes
I think you should write a story
Dec 28, 2017, 3:56 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, sorry, that was rude. I know you're just trying to help, and I appreciate that. I'm just quite emotionally volatile at the moment, and it's really difficult to talk about at the moment
Dec 28, 2017, 3:55 PM
George Hughes
But yes I'll stop now sorry
Dec 28, 2017, 3:55 PM
George Hughes
My bad, I'm just thinking if she has anxiety at all, she's refusing to let you give her a lift because she's worried about going out
Dec 28, 2017, 3:55 PM
Callum Davies
Can we please just stop talking about this?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno, do I?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:54 PM
George Hughes
Well during those meets, what is she like?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
Like once a month, if I'm lucky
Dec 28, 2017, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
She's always too fucking busy
Dec 28, 2017, 3:53 PM
George Hughes
You've seen her a few times though?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:53 PM
Callum Davies
😂😂😂 You think I see her at all?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
How does she act
Dec 28, 2017, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
I'm not talking about what she says, I'm talking about what you've observed
Dec 28, 2017, 3:52 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno. She doesn't tell me anything. I try to show an interest
Dec 28, 2017, 3:52 PM
George Hughes
Is she outgoing?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck me if I know? Maybe. It's not like she'd tell me if she does.
Dec 28, 2017, 3:51 PM
George Hughes
Or does she act the complete opposite?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:51 PM
George Hughes
Does she have anxiety at all?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
No, it's just the bus thing. She refuses to take help from anyone
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
She's not fallen out with anyone else there has she?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
Callum Davies
To Jasper's, for new year's
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
Haha
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
Are should I say
Dec 28, 2017, 3:50 PM
George Hughes
Where were you going to take her?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:49 PM
Callum Davies
But the buses won't run and she refuses to let me give her a lift, even though I told her it's no trouble whatsoever. She had it in her head that it's a burden on me, that's why we fell out
Dec 28, 2017, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
But the worst thing you can do is worry
Dec 28, 2017, 3:48 PM
George Hughes
If she wants to be there, she will be there
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
It's only special because of the people
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not doing anything! She wants to be there
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
All days are the same
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
What does it matter, it's worse to put pressure on her to be better by a certain date
Dec 28, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
New Years is just another day anyway
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
Callum Davies
In all likelihood
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
No?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, she's not coming for new year's
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry :)
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
Callum Davies
I'm giving her space though, trust me
Dec 28, 2017, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
Whether or not she actually needs it
Dec 28, 2017, 3:45 PM
Callum Davies
A few days!? New year's isn't that far away. We had plans 😞
Dec 28, 2017, 3:45 PM
George Hughes
She believes she needs alone time, right
Dec 28, 2017, 3:45 PM
George Hughes
Take your mind off her for a few days, she will message you when she's ready, and all will be well
Dec 28, 2017, 3:45 PM
George Hughes
If you want to know what would be best, try this
Dec 28, 2017, 3:44 PM
Callum Davies
I know, but at the same time, maybe some space will do her good. It's like I said to Kyle, sometimes people say they need alone time when they do, but something it's the worst possible thing they could do. So which one is this?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:44 PM
George Hughes
And you are a human, and you want to know everything even though it is trivial
Dec 28, 2017, 3:44 PM
Callum Davies
See the problem is that she never tells me anything, or ever does anything to put those worries to rest. And we've talked about this, her and I
Dec 28, 2017, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
She is a human, therefore she is blocking people out because she needs help
Dec 28, 2017, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
Think about this, humans are irrational stupid creatures that do things that don't make any sense
Dec 28, 2017, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
See the problem is that you worry
Dec 28, 2017, 3:42 PM
Callum Davies
Well, for one, I'm gonna be a barrel of laughs at new year's, aren't I?
😆George Hughes
Dec 28, 2017, 3:42 PM
Callum Davies
And I want to help her. Like, at this point, I'm not sure if she even still considers me her boyfriend. Like, what if she never messages back?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:41 PM
George Hughes
It's difficult because you're anxious about what she thinks of you yeah?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:40 PM
Callum Davies
You're number 4. Cas, Jasper, Kyle, now you have given me that advice. My last message to her was a goodnight text yesterday. Who knows how long before she messages me again? 😞
Dec 28, 2017, 3:40 PM
Callum Davies
And I felt a bit out of my depth, so I kind of sought advice from some of her oldest and closest friends, and the consensus seems to be that I'd be best giving her some space. Which I'm currently doing, but I'm finding it difficult
Dec 28, 2017, 3:38 PM
George Hughes
From the sounds of it, she probably needs space to think. Some people share everything, and some share things when they're ready.
I imagine she doesn't know how to share her problems so it's easier to just shut everyone out
Dec 28, 2017, 3:38 PM
Callum Davies
She's no good at sharing what's going on, and I care so much about her, that's where the problems arise
Dec 28, 2017, 3:37 PM
Callum Davies
Like, she's been going through some stuff at home, I think. And she was acting weird and kinda pushing me away, which caused me to (I know, totally unreasonably) get a bit annoyed at her, and then she kind of blew up at me, and she's not really accepting my apology of any of my help, so now I'm just really worried about her/ that I've screwed things up and made things worse now
Dec 28, 2017, 3:36 PM
George Hughes
I'm happy to listen if you want to tell
Dec 28, 2017, 3:36 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that's the problem, sort of. Okay, it's a long story.
Dec 28, 2017, 3:34 PM
Callum Davies
(That's not sarcasm, by the way. I genuinely am complimenting your deductive reasoning)
Dec 28, 2017, 3:34 PM
George Hughes
Have you spoken to her about whatever it is?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:34 PM
Callum Davies
Bingo. Good brain 😁
Dec 28, 2017, 3:33 PM
George Hughes
:/
Dec 28, 2017, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
Is this Julia?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:32 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that really depends
Dec 28, 2017, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
Okay, hope you're feeling better soon :)
Dec 28, 2017, 3:32 PM
Callum Davies
No, it's fine.
Dec 28, 2017, 3:31 PM
George Hughes
You sure? Can chat about it if you want
Dec 28, 2017, 3:31 PM
Callum Davies
Never mind
Dec 28, 2017, 3:30 PM
George Hughes
What's on your mind?
Dec 28, 2017, 3:30 PM
George Hughes
Glorious finale, I'm sure you enjoyed listening to that
Dec 21, 2017, 9:54 PM
George Hughes
Heyo, been off my phone all day soz.. oooft that last note...

It's lovely to hear the musical theatre students butchering 'Rent' 😁
Dec 21, 2017, 10:00 AM
Callum Davies
Goddamn. Bored and missing Julia. A lovely cocktail! You free to talk?
Dec 21, 2017, 9:58 AM
George Hughes
😂😂
Dec 21, 2017, 9:57 AM
Callum Davies
I honestly don't know
Dec 21, 2017, 9:55 AM
George Hughes
Why'd you bother going in then? 😂
Dec 21, 2017, 9:55 AM
Callum Davies
But college is so fucking boring today. Nothing's happening! 😩
Dec 21, 2017, 9:54 AM
George Hughes
Hear about*
Dec 21, 2017, 9:54 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha don't worry about it 😆 It was good to hear that about you and her 😁
Dec 21, 2017, 9:53 AM
Callum Davies
😅
Dec 21, 2017, 9:52 AM
Callum Davies
Not at all, the pleasure is all mine. Thanks for listening to me rant about Julia!
Dec 21, 2017, 9:52 AM
George Hughes
Hooray 🙄😂 That was fun last night btw cheers
Dec 21, 2017, 9:52 AM
Callum Davies
Yup, starting to get a slight hint of a headache 😁
Dec 21, 2017, 9:49 AM
George Hughes
All goood thanks, I assume you've managed to safely drive to college 😆
Dec 21, 2017, 9:49 AM
Callum Davies
How you doing?
Dec 21, 2017, 9:33 AM
George Hughes
Haha sounds goood
Dec 20, 2017, 12:50 PM
Callum Davies
Hmm, I need to motivate myself. Let's call it 2:00?
Dec 20, 2017, 12:49 PM
George Hughes
What time do you want to go in?
Dec 20, 2017, 12:49 PM
George Hughes
Aye I like it, been meaning to get into it
Dec 20, 2017, 12:41 PM
Callum Davies
It's great! 😁
Dec 20, 2017, 12:39 PM
George Hughes
Not much but I like it
Dec 20, 2017, 12:39 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. Do you watch it?
Dec 20, 2017, 12:38 PM
George Hughes
Is that archer? 😂

I do like watching the ground go by at a very high speed before my nose, always been a pleasure of mine
Dec 20, 2017, 12:18 PM
Callum Davies
Okay. Zoe on the roof, and you get strapped to the underside. Got it😁
Dec 20, 2017, 12:17 PM
George Hughes
That way you won't have to listen to us argue
Dec 20, 2017, 12:17 PM
George Hughes
I'll gladly tie Zo to the roof 💁‍♂️
Dec 20, 2017, 12:17 PM
Callum Davies
Awesome. I'll let you two argue about who's going in the back! Or I'll just get the rope and tie one of you to the roof! 😂
Dec 20, 2017, 12:16 PM
George Hughes
Actually, we can just go in our two selves, Zo might join us😁
Dec 20, 2017, 12:14 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha totally me neither 😂
Dec 20, 2017, 12:12 PM
Callum Davies
OK. That'd be great! I'll text you later, if I'm going to have to get ready! I'm totally NOT still in my PJs. 😳
Dec 20, 2017, 12:11 PM
George Hughes
Not sure yet, but I'm going in with the family, you'd be welcome to join us I imagine
Dec 20, 2017, 12:10 PM
Callum Davies
When you going? I need to do some shopping, but I've been putting it off! I'll give you a lift
Dec 20, 2017, 12:09 PM
George Hughes
That'd be fun!
Dec 20, 2017, 12:08 PM
George Hughes
Well I'm going into town to do my Christmas shopping this afternoon, I could come over later tho?
Dec 20, 2017, 12:08 PM
Callum Davies
I totally forgot I'm free on a Wednesday! 😅 Wanna come round and play video games or something like that?
Dec 20, 2017, 10:43 AM
Callum Davies
Are you free today?
Dec 20, 2017, 10:41 AM
George Hughes
I hope you enjoy being busy ;)
Dec 12, 2017, 8:36 PM
Callum Davies
College up until the 22nd, ice skating with Julia on the 23rd, and then of course Christmas Eve and Christmas
Dec 12, 2017, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
It's cool, after Christmas is fine
Dec 12, 2017, 8:34 PM
Callum Davies
Not until after Christmas, it look like
Dec 12, 2017, 8:33 PM
George Hughes
I'm sure you'll have a free evening with a free morning after it some day😛
Dec 12, 2017, 8:33 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not sure what I'll be doing.
Dec 12, 2017, 8:32 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, maybe. I'll see
Dec 12, 2017, 8:32 PM
George Hughes
Want to go to the pub one night?
Dec 12, 2017, 8:32 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, that's cool
Dec 12, 2017, 8:31 PM
George Hughes
Nah, but I'll be back on the 16th and free from 18th onward :P
Dec 12, 2017, 8:30 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, are you still in brig?
Dec 12, 2017, 8:27 PM

How did your panto go??
Dec 9, 2017, 6:36 PM
George Hughes
Yeah hope you get well soon as well bro
Dec 8, 2017, 3:26 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, thanks. Hope you get well soon 🤒
Dec 8, 2017, 3:23 PM
George Hughes
Hope it goes awesome (by that I mean I hope you don't have a coughing fit on stage 😉)
Dec 8, 2017, 3:16 PM
George Hughes
Sorry again, I was really looking forward to seeing you in action
Dec 8, 2017, 3:16 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
Dec 8, 2017, 3:15 PM
Callum Davies
To be honest, that'd be a good thing, it'd cover up the noise of me doing the same! 😂 But I understand totally understand, don't worry about it.
Dec 8, 2017, 3:04 PM
George Hughes
Hey I'm gonna have to give it a miss, I'd be obnoxiously loudly coughing through the whole thing
Dec 8, 2017, 3:02 PM
Callum Davies
Not a problem. May I just ask that either way, could you please let me know by about 3 or 4 pm today what's happening. Just so i know whether or not to pick you up. And my messenger on my phone has been playing up recently, so could you please text me instead of using messenger? cheers, and good luck. everything crossed for you
Dec 8, 2017, 12:57 PM
George Hughes
Cheers 😁
Dec 8, 2017, 12:54 PM
Callum Davies
Shit! I hope I'm not too late, but obviously, good luck with your exam today!
Dec 8, 2017, 12:37 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I'll let you know how I feel, it might pass
Dec 7, 2017, 10:25 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, just let me know tomorrow if you want me to pick you up for the pantomime or not. You may feel different in the morning tomorrow😉
Dec 7, 2017, 10:25 PM

Dec 7, 2017, 5:13 PM

Who knows!? 😂 I think so, but my voice is a bit croaky
Dec 7, 2017, 5:12 PM
George Hughes
Are you still managing to perform?
Dec 7, 2017, 5:11 PM
Callum Davies

Dec 7, 2017, 5:11 PM

Aww noo, how are you coping?
Dec 7, 2017, 5:05 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine. I've gotten the same thing. 😣
Dec 7, 2017, 5:04 PM
George Hughes
I'm sorry
Dec 7, 2017, 5:02 PM
George Hughes
Hey Callum, I've come down with a horrific fever, I hate to say it but I don't think I'll be well enough to see your pantomime 😢 Especially since I've got an exam tomorrow afternoon as well...
Dec 7, 2017, 5:01 PM
Callum Davies
hey man, a group of my friends (inc kyle) are setting up a cards against humanity online game now if you'd like to join. Best if you use a laptop
Dec 2, 2017, 2:11 PM
Callum Davies
Plus, I was kinda rushing 💁🏻
Dec 2, 2017, 2:01 PM
Callum Davies
If I do ever cut myself, it's always on the chin. Damn this chiseled jawline 😂
Dec 2, 2017, 2:01 PM
George Hughes
Oh deear, I've been using the same blade for over a year and I've not cut myself once
Dec 2, 2017, 2:00 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, I dunno what did it. It just started flushing weird one day 😂 Time for a new blade I reckon, I cut myself!
Dec 2, 2017, 1:59 PM
George Hughes
Did keir block your toilet? 😂
Dec 2, 2017, 1:49 PM
George Hughes
It's cool brooo
Dec 2, 2017, 1:49 PM

Hey, sorry. I was unblocking my fucking toilet! 😡 Just lemme have a shave and I'll be right with you😂

Yeah that's probably the easiest way to do it
Nov 22, 2017, 8:58 PM
Callum Davies
I know. It's not gonna be easy, and I'm not going cold turkey (if you'll pardon the pun), just gradually easing meat out of my diet
Nov 22, 2017, 8:53 PM
George Hughes
But yeah good for you 😁
Nov 22, 2017, 8:53 PM
George Hughes
Hmm, although bacon 😉
Nov 22, 2017, 8:52 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, on that point. I may be going veggie, after pressure from my girlfriend and a prolonged consideration of it for a while
Nov 22, 2017, 8:52 PM
George Hughes
Oh boy I've just had the most delicious burger, me and my flatmate just cooked up some gorgeous scran
Nov 22, 2017, 8:51 PM
Callum Davies
I try my best 😊
Nov 22, 2017, 8:49 PM
George Hughes
About my attractiveness? 😂 you're too kind😆
Nov 22, 2017, 8:49 PM
Callum Davies
😂 I was gonna make a joke like that, but I couldn't work.out how to phrase it
Nov 22, 2017, 8:47 PM
George Hughes
I'll go sit at the back then 💁‍♂️😇
Nov 22, 2017, 8:45 PM
Callum Davies
I was just about to say, hopefully there's nobody attractive in the front row 😂
Nov 22, 2017, 8:45 PM
George Hughes
Just don't get too excited
Nov 22, 2017, 8:44 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
Nov 22, 2017, 8:44 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yeah, comfy. Just, very close fitting, put it that way. You know what I'm meaning...😐
Nov 22, 2017, 8:44 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha now you know what girls have to live with 😂although I always assumed they were quite comfy 💁‍♂️
Nov 22, 2017, 8:43 PM
Callum Davies
They're awful! 😂
Nov 22, 2017, 8:42 PM
Callum Davies
My costume involves these leggings things, and they are the tightest thing known to man! 😂
Nov 22, 2017, 8:41 PM
George Hughes
Even better 😆
Nov 22, 2017, 8:41 PM
Callum Davies
Twice! 😂 Once in the rehearsal, then again for the actual show 😂
Nov 22, 2017, 8:39 PM
George Hughes
Nah don't worry about it! It'll be great to see you in action haha
Nov 22, 2017, 8:38 PM

Why did my autocorrect do that?
Nov 22, 2017, 8:38 PM
Callum Davies
*To it an hour early
Nov 22, 2017, 8:38 PM
Callum Davies
Not at all. If anything I feel awkward dragging you too it an hour early
Nov 22, 2017, 8:37 PM
George Hughes
Sure. Thank you 😁 Hope I'm not being too awkward
Nov 22, 2017, 8:36 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then. Well, I could drop the ticket off to your house tomorrow anyway, just in case. But I'd be happy to pick you up
Nov 22, 2017, 8:17 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I wouldn't mind, I have an exam that afternoon though, but I'll be back in time
Nov 22, 2017, 8:14 PM
Callum Davies
Well, as long as you're alright with being an hour.early. it starts at 7, but actors have to be there for 6
Nov 22, 2017, 8:10 PM
George Hughes
Cause you could probably just give it to me then? If that worked
Nov 22, 2017, 8:08 PM
George Hughes
That might be easiest, are you able to pick me up to take me to the show?
Nov 22, 2017, 8:08 PM
Callum Davies
Hi George, I've got your pantomime ticket now. Will I just drop it round to your mum, or?
Nov 22, 2017, 7:39 PM

I can give the college a lesson in cables, if there's one thing I'm good at, it's organising wires🙄
Nov 15, 2017, 4:19 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
Nov 15, 2017, 4:18 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that would be misplaced trust 😂
Nov 15, 2017, 4:11 PM
George Hughes
I trust your wiring is of optimal standard
Nov 15, 2017, 4:08 PM
Callum Davies
Not my wiring. I thought exactly the same thing
Nov 15, 2017, 4:08 PM
George Hughes
Eww there are better ways to do that 😂

Yup, sometimes the wiring can be a bit mind boggling, though
Nov 15, 2017, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
Haha about right 😂 That's cool, I can imagine you would be enjoying it, right up your street 😁
Nov 15, 2017, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, so so. The partying is fun. The work, not so much! 😂 No, in honesty, I'm finding the course really interesting
Nov 15, 2017, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
Awesome! How's college life btw?
Nov 15, 2017, 4:03 PM
Callum Davies
Like, it pretty much is boyfriend girlfriend type thing, we just don't wanna call it that yet. I'm seeing her on Friday, so that's something to look forward to
Nov 15, 2017, 3:58 PM
George Hughes
Sick moves dude
Nov 15, 2017, 3:56 PM
Callum Davies
Well yes. And she's obviously interested in me. Otherwise we wouldn't have spent all night kissing and cuddling the night we met 😏
Nov 15, 2017, 3:56 PM
George Hughes
Well you're obviously interested in this girl 💁‍♂️
Nov 15, 2017, 3:55 PM
Callum Davies
What's that meant to mean? You could literally be telling me to do anything in this situation! 😂
Nov 15, 2017, 3:55 PM
George Hughes
If you want it, go for it bruh 😁
Nov 15, 2017, 3:54 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, met her through a mutual friend a few days ago. And we really seem to be clicking, but we're hesitant to put any labels on it yet. It is whatever it is, but at the moment, it seems good. 😉
Nov 15, 2017, 3:53 PM
George Hughes
Friend?? Oooh!😏
Nov 15, 2017, 3:51 PM
Callum Davies
I don't think so. Well, you know my mum, and she's going to be in it! The only other people I'm buying tickets for are Ben (friend from college) and Julia (erm...friend?) 😂
Nov 15, 2017, 3:47 PM
George Hughes
Yeah skippinish 😛 mum booked tickets. I'd hate to be awkward though, is anyone else I know going to see it?
Nov 15, 2017, 3:45 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then. If needs be, I could maybe give you a lift
Nov 15, 2017, 2:43 PM
Callum Davies
Saturday is our last performance this year, but you're seeing skippinache then, aren't you?
Nov 15, 2017, 2:43 PM
George Hughes
Haha fairs 🙄 listen I really want to make it so get me a ticket and I'll see what I can do
Nov 15, 2017, 2:43 PM
Callum Davies
I'm guessing roughly once a year! 😂 It's a pantomime.
Nov 15, 2017, 2:42 PM
George Hughes
How often will you do a show like this?
Nov 15, 2017, 2:42 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, well tickets are on sale to general public now, so should I not get you a ticket this evening? Bear in mind that they might be sold out by the time Sunday comes around
Nov 15, 2017, 2:41 PM
George Hughes
But I'll check bus times later
Nov 15, 2017, 2:37 PM
George Hughes
So I'd be cutting it fine for getting back to Perth in time
Nov 15, 2017, 2:37 PM
George Hughes
Turns out I have an exam on that Friday
Nov 15, 2017, 2:36 PM
Callum Davies
Don't worry, I've got it. Friday, right? I'll try to buy your ticket today and get it to you soon.
Nov 15, 2017, 2:23 PM
Callum Davies
Hey man, could you remind me what date you wanted the pantomime ticket for?
Nov 15, 2017, 2:16 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine
Sep 29, 2017, 1:48 PM
George Hughes
Euan might be here by then so he'll probs come to the station as well
Sep 29, 2017, 1:31 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's an idea
Sep 29, 2017, 1:28 PM
Callum Davies
Would you be cool if I meet the guy at the station as well, and we all go together? Remember I'm coming in about 6:10, all being well
Sep 29, 2017, 1:26 PM
Callum Davies
Cool, sounds good

What's the actual address of this place anyway?
Sep 29, 2017, 1:20 PM
Callum Davies
Nope. It's actually one of Kyle's friends, he seems decent.
Sep 29, 2017, 1:19 PM
George Hughes
Does he not fit in your rucksack?
Sep 29, 2017, 1:17 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I can't bring him, but I'll say it's fine for him to be there. I'll give him a message
Sep 29, 2017, 1:17 PM
George Hughes
Bring him along 😝
Sep 29, 2017, 1:15 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, by the way, one of my friends is in Edinburgh today really near us. I wasn't sure how private the party was, so I said I'd ask you
Sep 29, 2017, 1:15 PM
George Hughes
It looks decent 😂
Sep 29, 2017, 1:11 PM
George Hughes
Talking of youtubers with books, george miller wrote a book called Francis of the Filth
Sep 29, 2017, 1:11 PM
George Hughes
Oh right yeah you've shown me his videos! That's pretty cool!
Sep 29, 2017, 1:11 PM
Callum Davies
He also makes adventure games as well
Sep 29, 2017, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, it reads like there's heavy hitchhiker's and disk world influences. In fact, he cites Douglas Adams and Terry Pratchett as some of his main influences. It's very funny 😁 I don't know if you've ever watched Zero Punctuation on YouTube; it's the same guy. His actual name is Benjamin, but he goes by Yahtzee. God knows why
Sep 29, 2017, 1:06 PM
George Hughes
Sounds sort of like ironic humour, but if hitchhikers influence in there maybe?

So I'll give you a text when I'm at the train station in Edinburgh?
Sep 28, 2017, 10:01 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha don't worry you're fine :P Better to be sure eh
Sep 28, 2017, 9:14 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers. I feel like I'm just firing too many questions at you and next party you'll just be like "Nah, best not invite Callum. Too much hassle" 😂
Sep 28, 2017, 8:21 PM
George Hughes
Yeah for sure
Sep 28, 2017, 7:55 PM
Callum Davies
Am I alright travelling in casual stuff and then throwing a shirt and blazer on at your place?
Sep 28, 2017, 7:37 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. Cheers 😉
Sep 28, 2017, 7:28 PM
George Hughes
You can dress however you like, but casual smart is the usual 😝
Sep 28, 2017, 7:03 PM
Callum Davies
By the way, I'm assuming there's no sort of dress code to the party? I'm not quite feeling like suiting up for this one. But my feelings might change 😂 But I'm fine going casual if I want, yeah?
Sep 28, 2017, 5:22 PM
Callum Davies
Look forward 😉
Sep 28, 2017, 3:59 PM
George Hughes
You excited? Gonna be a good night!

Sep 28, 2017, 3:54 PM

Ohhh, okay. Wait, he was an explorer as well, I'm pretty sure! He should definitely have a sleeping bag! It's fine,I'll happily lend him a sleeping bag 😊
Sep 28, 2017, 3:49 PM

Yep, it seems legitimate

Well the media have already covered it and a game developer even tried to file a copyright claim against some of his videos because of the swear, but his like to dislike ratio is the same as ever

I don't own it. Plus, college is really hectic right now; fresher's, making new friends, meeting up with them, meeting up with old friends, doing the actual course. For example, tomorrow I'm both working on the car for a good few hours, then helping a new college friend move in during the evening. Would it be cool if we waited until the hustle and bustle of starting college dies down?

But is there a whole Ainsley Harriot story arc I'm not getting?
Aug 27, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
I do quite like his newer stuff
Aug 27, 2017, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
But I think it's cause his humour is so down to earth and natural
Aug 27, 2017, 9:59 PM
George Hughes
He is weirdly entertaining
Aug 27, 2017, 9:59 PM
Callum Davies
Why have I watched about 50 of your videos, you strange, entertaining man child?

Aug 27, 2017, 9:59 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I'll catch it tomorrow
Aug 27, 2017, 10:30 AM
Callum Davies
Wubalubadubdub! New episode tonight! Well, tomorrow for me. I know they air @ 11:30pm over in America, which is like 3:30 in the morning for us. I'd be willing to stay up till 11:30 for it, but not 3:30! I just tend to either catch them the next day on YouTube before they get taken down, or catch them on watch cartoons online
Aug 27, 2017, 8:02 AM
Callum Davies
I'll put it in my watch later list

Hiya, just a quick wee update. Mum says it's fine for you coming round, you can stay over, but just bear in mind that she has little ones in the morning as well. (From about 8am) And I said I'd walk the dog today, so would you mind if when we get back to mine, we take the dog out for a wee walk, then we'll be free to do whatever
Aug 15, 2017, 1:12 PM

Aug 15, 2017, 1:01 PM

I'll talk to mum about it. To save fiddling around with air beds, I do have a double bed, if you're okay with that?
Aug 15, 2017, 1:00 PM
George Hughes
I can see about getting a lift back, or if it's not too awkward, stay at yours?
Aug 15, 2017, 1:00 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's all good
Aug 15, 2017, 12:59 PM
Callum Davies
Also, you ended up paying 2 rounds to my 1 last time. So first one tonight's on me
Aug 15, 2017, 12:57 PM
Callum Davies
Ooh, I should probably mention, mum's working today, so until about 6 we'll just need to be away in my room. And sure, but how are you getting back then? Because if I'm drinking, I'll not be good to drive. And I really didn't feel too good after last time, I don't know why. I'm usually so good at handling my alcohol. I might just have one or two standard strength beers, if it's all the same to you
Aug 15, 2017, 12:57 PM
George Hughes
Sure that's fine
Aug 15, 2017, 12:55 PM
George Hughes
Fancy having a drink tonight then? :p
Aug 15, 2017, 12:54 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, I'll head off at about 2:30, so I can get time to browse Primark for about a half hour. Is it okay if I try to get parked in Scott Street car park? And not that I know of, there's like a 95% chance it'll stay that way. Why?
Aug 15, 2017, 12:54 PM
George Hughes
Are you working tomorrow btw?
Aug 15, 2017, 12:52 PM
George Hughes
Sure, I'll finish up around half 3 so then would be awesome
Aug 15, 2017, 12:51 PM
Callum Davies
I could pick you up from town if you'd like. My car actually has loads of storage once I fold the seats back. I could pick your equipment up, drop it off at your house, and then we could head on to mine. Or we could just take it to mine, and unload when I drop you back. It's good either way. I want to check Primark for some V-neck t-shirts to use as undershirts anyway. What time do you want me to pick you up?
Aug 15, 2017, 12:50 PM
George Hughes
I'm just away in to town to busk for a while but after that sure
Aug 15, 2017, 12:47 PM
Callum Davies
You free today? I could maybe pick you up at about 2 if you want to just hang out this afternoon
Aug 15, 2017, 12:46 PM
George Hughes
Well I'm away for a few days on Sunday but apart from that aye
Aug 15, 2017, 12:45 PM

Aug 15, 2017, 11:24 AM

Also listen to Olive Tree by Scale the Summit, M4 has that kind of suspended chord echo vibe
Aug 14, 2017, 9:50 AM
George Hughes
Although it kinda reminds a little of Reservoir by Metronomy
Aug 14, 2017, 9:46 AM

Aug 12, 2017, 7:24 PM

Got it. Just giving it a listen now
Aug 12, 2017, 7:23 PM
George Hughes
Neat, it's an incredible track
Aug 12, 2017, 7:21 PM
Callum Davies
Will do. I'll download it now to listen to later
Aug 12, 2017, 7:20 PM
George Hughes
That is an inspiration
Aug 12, 2017, 7:20 PM
George Hughes
Also listen to Eternal Rains will Come by Opeth
Aug 12, 2017, 7:20 PM
George Hughes
You're right about Haken tho
Aug 12, 2017, 7:19 PM
George Hughes
I could 😆 although there's a pop song by that name and I couldn't mentally get past that😂
Aug 12, 2017, 7:19 PM
Callum Davies
Just release it as Bounce. It's a nice enigmatic title. There's definitely an air of the Haken about it
Aug 12, 2017, 7:18 PM
George Hughes
It's not 😂 it's just cause I bounced down all the tracks.. of course it's not finished yet 💁‍♂️
Aug 12, 2017, 7:17 PM
Callum Davies
Don't quite know why it's called Bounce though 🤔
Aug 12, 2017, 7:16 PM

Oh yeah, forgot about that. Super armour plated xenomorph Beth!
Aug 12, 2017, 2:59 PM

And she went on that retreat with jerry to sort their marriage
Aug 12, 2017, 2:58 PM
George Hughes
She knows about the portals and aliens taking over the earth for a while etc
Aug 12, 2017, 2:58 PM
Callum Davies
Well Beth has never actually gone on an adventure with them, so I'm not entirely sure just how wilful her ignorance is
Aug 12, 2017, 2:57 PM
George Hughes
I think Beth is the odd one out, cause she's wilfully ignorant but both Rick and Morty accept the dark truth of the multiverse
Aug 12, 2017, 2:56 PM
Callum Davies
He takes after his mother, who takes after her father. Aka Rick
Aug 12, 2017, 2:54 PM

Rickest Rick just gets paradoxical 😆

You can be the most intuitive person in the world but if you're not proactive, you're still useless 😛

And Rick C-137 is the Rickest Rick of them all
Aug 12, 2017, 2:53 PM

Hey, Morty C-137 is really intuitive
Aug 12, 2017, 2:53 PM
George Hughes
He really takes after his father
Aug 12, 2017, 2:52 PM

Lawyer Morty, just as useless as the rest of them
Aug 12, 2017, 2:52 PM

But I still think he's known as lawyer Morty
Aug 12, 2017, 2:52 PM

I want a pet lawyer Morty
Aug 12, 2017, 2:52 PM

He's not a lawyer tho 😝

Aug 12, 2017, 2:48 PM

That is a sound criticism, I shall take it into account. I'm able to take constructive criticism on board. Thanks for the advice. 👍🏻
Aug 12, 2017, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
Of course I could be completely wrong about you, but I thought it was worth mentioning either way 💁‍♂️
Aug 12, 2017, 10:56 AM
George Hughes
You have an ego. That ego likes to present itself as being intelligent, which you are. However, you may unconsciously feel slightly insecure about this at times, which is perfectly normal. You counteract this by using unusually complex vocabulary in every day conversation.
Here is the useful part:
You're interested in gaining female attention, right. People like to have an easy going conversation. Girls are people. 😉
What I'm getting at is, when you use complex language, I find it slightly overwhelming and used to make me feel mentally inferior. (Do not feel guilty, all this is perfectly natural and can be taken for granted as normal behaviour)

So my conclusion is: if u want dat hole, u gotta talk like a mongo 😝

I don't think they want to make money from it as such, the only version I can find is the clip on adult swim's channel from the episode :P
Aug 11, 2017, 10:03 PM
Callum Davies
But I'd imagine they'd have developed it into a full song and given it a proper release as a single by now. Seems like a perfect money making scheme. Or just release it for free as a gift to the fans. That seems more like Roiland and Harmon's style
Aug 11, 2017, 10:02 PM
George Hughes
Not on spotify
Aug 11, 2017, 10:01 PM
George Hughes
I don't think it is a full song xD
Aug 11, 2017, 10:00 PM

Have they released that as a full song yet? I'd be amazed if they haven't yet

Wait, I've just realised. We had John Oliver in season one, Stephen Colbert made an appearance in the second season, could we maybe expect and appearance from Conan O'Brien in season three of Rick and Morty? They seem to be getting their way through the American late night hosts! 😂
Aug 10, 2017, 9:15 PM
George Hughes
I've heard about community but never seen any of it
Aug 10, 2017, 1:38 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yeah, to beat up the devil. ANd I've just now realised that the person in episode 2 was John Oliver. I suppose it wouldn't have been hard to get him, since Oliver and Harmon previously worked together on Community
Aug 10, 2017, 1:14 PM

Well Morty became a car, rick and summer became buff, there's bound to be more

Aug 10, 2017, 1:04 PM

I mean, so are pretty much all the episodes if you analyse them enough. I've just been watching the wisecrack playlist of their r&m philosphy videos. But yeah, pretty deep. Lots of fun too

Hmm, take it round we'll see what we'd need to do
Aug 2, 2017, 9:55 AM

It would take 2 seconds, and trust me, I know what I'm doing. I've done it many times before. I need it taken off my hands!
Aug 2, 2017, 9:54 AM

It would only need the very surface taking off. It wouldn't even void the warranty. But your wish is respected
Aug 2, 2017, 9:52 AM

Thanks tho 😁
Aug 2, 2017, 9:51 AM

Yeah I do, although it's running perfectly fine so I'm not to keen on taking it apart if it doesn't need 😝
Aug 2, 2017, 9:51 AM

But seriously, I do have a spare 4gb ram chip if you want it
Aug 2, 2017, 9:51 AM

Aug 2, 2017, 9:50 AM

Oh, do you have your laptop with you from uni at home? I could see if I can *ahem* ram some more RAM in it for you

Although I would suggest being responsible and not having anything, but I'm no fun :P
Aug 2, 2017, 8:33 AM

Or should I stay safe and not touch a drop. That's probably the most responsible option. I hate being a responsible adult

The upstairs one, think it's the rum bar
Aug 2, 2017, 8:13 AM

See ya there. Oh, what bar is the open mic in? The venue has a gin bar, a rum bar, and a whisky and wine bar
Aug 2, 2017, 8:12 AM

Aug 2, 2017, 8:10 AM

But what if the hand that feeds you looks tasty. Eat the food from the hand, then eat the hand as well. Double food
Aug 1, 2017, 1:21 PM
George Hughes
Yeah don't bite the hand that feeds you

We literally need trees to live. I don't want to kill too many of them with my exhaust pipe
Aug 1, 2017, 1:20 PM
George Hughes
Yep 😆
Aug 1, 2017, 1:20 PM
Callum Davies
Sounds fine by me. Probably best for the environment 🌲
Aug 1, 2017, 1:20 PM
George Hughes
It's cool, if you drive here, we'll take you up with us in the car and then back to ours so you can drive home?
Aug 1, 2017, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
If your mum wants, I'm more than happy to split the drive to the gig. My car can theoretically hold 4 passengers, more realistically, three. If she wants to bung some people in my car to get there, that's fine with me 😁
Aug 1, 2017, 1:16 PM
Callum Davies
That's fine 😁

Have you ever seen John Oliver's unofficial mascot for Marlboro? Jeff the Diseased Lung
Jul 31, 2017, 1:27 PM
George Hughes
Would you fancy trying a Marlboro? ;)
Jul 31, 2017, 8:55 AM
George Hughes
That sounds really good 😁
Jul 31, 2017, 8:54 AM
Callum Davies
Yup, 18:40 till 22.50, if I'm taking the bus. Plenty of time for a natter and a drink. Does that sound okay with you?
Jul 31, 2017, 7:49 AM
Callum Davies
Meet you there? Then I'll take the last bus back home afterwards. 22:50, if memory serves
Jul 31, 2017, 7:13 AM
Callum Davies
Latest bus from Abernethy to brig gets into the main Street at 18:40. I know the buses back to Abernethy from brig are a bit better, but do you want to say 18:40 at the last cast tomorrow?
Jul 31, 2017, 7:12 AM
George Hughes
Thank you!! 😄
Jul 30, 2017, 7:53 PM

Oh, wow. Hope you get it! 😁
Jul 30, 2017, 5:55 PM

Application for the flat we're hopefully gonna get
Jul 30, 2017, 4:37 PM

Public transport isn't that bad😂
Jul 30, 2017, 4:37 PM

Either I don't drink, or I'll have to use.... public transportation 😖
Jul 30, 2017, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
Application?
Jul 30, 2017, 1:04 PM
George Hughes
I'll be in brig for another week or so assuming our application is successful
Jul 30, 2017, 11:22 AM

Any day next week is great

Monday, ie tomorrow, is looking pretty busy, going to sort out bank stuff for college and stuff like that, but Tuesday onwards seems pretty quiet for me

Jul 30, 2017, 11:07 AM

How long are you in brig for? Work's really quiet at the moment, so I probably won't be getting many shifts, and today's my last day so far, so do you want to meet up sometime in the very near future?
Jul 30, 2017, 11:07 AM

There's a cult club? That's amazing! You NEED to introduce them to medium rare, if you remember that

To overcome stage fright and gain the satisfaction of performing, one must subject themselves to the experience of being in front of an audience

Callum Davies
Or have daddy's money. But I understand what you mean. Very philosophical
Jul 26, 2017, 1:27 PM
George Hughes
Well to live somewhere comfortable, one must work which is sometimes uncomfortable
Jul 26, 2017, 1:26 PM
Callum Davies
?
Jul 26, 2017, 1:26 PM
George Hughes
Discomfort brings comfort
Jul 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
George Hughes
Very true
Jul 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
Callum Davies
I think the definition of comfortable changes from person to person
Jul 26, 2017, 1:24 PM
George Hughes
Certainly 1 bedroom flats are, but maybe studio flats are as well
Jul 26, 2017, 1:22 PM
Callum Davies
Aren't studio flats highly desirable nowadays? Aren't they very chic?
Jul 26, 2017, 1:22 PM
George Hughes
Although standards are shifting, comfortable can be living in a studio flat with just above living wage
Jul 26, 2017, 1:21 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha that's a good one 😂😂
Jul 26, 2017, 1:20 PM
Callum Davies
It's like that Eddie Izzard joke.
"I am Robin Hood! I rob from the rich to give to the poor! You, sir! Are you rich!"
"Well, I wouldn't say I'm rich. Comfortable"
"Well, what am I supposed to do with that? Comfortable isn't rich. I don't rob from the comfortable and give to those with a few outstanding bills!"
Jul 26, 2017, 1:20 PM

Enjoy it while it lasts :p
Jul 26, 2017, 1:17 PM

It is a good feeling 😁
Jul 26, 2017, 1:17 PM

I am a happy man. Well, contented. I know money is evil and all that, but you have to admit that it feels good when you feel that you have enough. Not loads, but enough. I'm feeling like that at the moment
Jul 26, 2017, 1:16 PM
George Hughes
No bother, hope you had a good time! Chat later
Jul 24, 2017, 9:35 PM

That's fine, I only wanted to call to more quickly tell you what I said in that messages
Jul 23, 2017, 7:54 AM
George Hughes
Sorry I was at a gig, been busy chatting to folk all night
Jul 23, 2017, 2:21 AM
George Hughes
Hopefully we can get euan back on board
Jul 23, 2017, 2:21 AM
George Hughes
I should be free Thursday evening. We'll call then :)
Jul 23, 2017, 2:21 AM
Callum Davies
Basically, I'm working on Friday now, so I'm afraid we'd have to reschedule Borderlands. But Euan is still giving people the cold shoulder, so we'd probably have to play just the two of us. However, I can forsee a situation in which Euan comes back into contact with all of us, and is then really annoyed that we played Borderlands without him, a situation which I don't think we want. So should we just put the Borderlands on hiatus until we hear from Euan again? I am free Thursday evening at about 8 for a chat, though. If you'd like
Jul 22, 2017, 7:22 PM
Callum Davies
Could I call you real quick?
Jul 22, 2017, 7:08 PM
George Hughes
Hey
Jul 22, 2017, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Hi George
Jul 22, 2017, 7:06 PM
Callum Davies
That's sound analysis, I think. I just don't know what to do
Jul 17, 2017, 9:03 AM
George Hughes
But that's speculation.
Jul 17, 2017, 8:49 AM
George Hughes
I think he struggles to rely on/trust people since his family haven't done much for him so he feels he has to get rid of anyone who, like his family, don't do much to support themselves/others - hence why he attacked Kyle, and why he dislikes my attitude towards transport
Jul 17, 2017, 8:49 AM
George Hughes
That's unfortunately very relevant. But I really don't know how to get through to him
Jul 17, 2017, 8:46 AM
Callum Davies
Well may I tell a cautionary tale? I have another friend, he started to act like this. I too thought nothing of it, as you are. He tried to kill himself. We got him therapy and he's fine now. I. I'm not saying that's the case with with Euan, but what if?
Jul 17, 2017, 8:00 AM
George Hughes
I'm sure he'll be fine :)
Jul 17, 2017, 7:28 AM
Callum Davies
God, I hope he's okay. I'd call him, but that'd probably only make it worse
Jul 16, 2017, 7:28 PM
George Hughes
Wonder what's going on then
Jul 16, 2017, 4:47 PM
Callum Davies
Kyle was friends with Euan on Facebook. Euan's deleted Kyle too. What's going on. It's obviously not just us, then
Jul 16, 2017, 4:41 PM
Callum Davies
First female doctor!
Jul 16, 2017, 4:33 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow!
Jul 16, 2017, 4:32 PM
Callum Davies
Also, Jodie Whittaker is the 13th doctor.. literally just been announced
Jul 16, 2017, 4:31 PM
George Hughes
He's always been pretty closed off
Jul 16, 2017, 4:31 PM
Callum Davies
Wait, it's just dawned on me. When I checked Euan's Facebook friends, he only had 8 people on there. I can (sort of) understand him removing us two, but would he have been friends with Kyle and Beth and that ilk? I see no reason why they would piss him off. It seems as if he's trying to cut himself off for whatever reason, leaving only his family and closest friends. What's going on with him? I don't just think it was us two, I think something bigger may be happening.
Jul 16, 2017, 4:14 PM
Callum Davies
Maybe...
Jul 16, 2017, 2:09 PM
George Hughes
I'm quite sure he'll be fine, but give him a little space for a bit
Jul 16, 2017, 12:29 PM
George Hughes
Haha aww 😕
Jul 16, 2017, 12:28 PM

I'm more worried than a decearing egg
Jul 16, 2017, 8:48 AM

Christ, I'm worried about him.
Jul 16, 2017, 8:46 AM
Callum Davies
He appears to have unfriended me on Facebook. And looking through his current friends list, he's unfriended you too
Jul 16, 2017, 8:43 AM
George Hughes
You've said you're there for him, hopefully he'll chat when he's ready :/
Jul 15, 2017, 10:07 PM
George Hughes
I've got his number thanks. Hmm let him cool off from the other day maybe?
Jul 15, 2017, 10:06 PM
Callum Davies
Well, he's not answering his mobile.
Jul 15, 2017, 7:41 PM
Callum Davies
I'll give it to you if you need. I'll call him in a minute
Jul 15, 2017, 7:38 PM
Callum Davies
Do you have his mobile?
Jul 15, 2017, 7:38 PM
George Hughes
I wouldn't know what to say, but might be good to check up on him
Jul 15, 2017, 7:23 PM

Should we give Euan a call? In worried about him😥

Yeah I like watching the pilot 😆
Jul 14, 2017, 7:54 PM

It's weird to see season one, before the voice actors had fully developed their characters' voices
Jul 14, 2017, 5:44 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, he's probably on right now, but I'm lying on my bed, and I just ate a hell of a lot of soup, so I'm not actually sure if I'm capable of getting up to go to my laptop at the moment
Jul 14, 2017, 5:39 PM
George Hughes
I think if we just go on steam and message him at 8 or whatever, he'll come on
Jul 14, 2017, 5:35 PM
George Hughes
It also means you supported the creators
Jul 14, 2017, 5:34 PM
Callum Davies
I love the show too, which is why I bought it in dvd. Maybe not quite as convenient as having it online, but it actually being on the disk means I don't have to rely on streaming
Jul 14, 2017, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
But the DVDs don't have a "play all" feature, and no subtitles. So I can't be lazy and only half pay attention to what they're actually saying
Jul 14, 2017, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
Euan hasn't replied to our post yet😞
Jul 14, 2017, 5:29 PM

I've bought the entire box set of Futurama, so I'm slowly working my way through that. It comes in one of those big dvd stacks, but one of the hinges has started to break away at one end. Hopefully it doesn't develop any further

George Hughes
Yeah you've worked really hard this past year
Jul 14, 2017, 4:13 PM
Callum Davies
Fair point. But I've almost broken my back working for it. I think I've earned it, if I do say so myself😌
Jul 14, 2017, 4:13 PM
George Hughes

Jul 14, 2017, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
I've got about a 10th of what you've got saved
Jul 14, 2017, 4:12 PM
George Hughes
You'll be fine 😁
Jul 14, 2017, 4:11 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I understand. I'm just thinking how I'll do. Well, I can obviously apply for the £4,750 every year, which I think will just do me, given I'm not having to pay accommodation. And then I have a little over £10,000 in the account to fall back on if it's not, so I should be fine, I think 🙂
Jul 14, 2017, 4:10 PM
George Hughes
It's 7,000 for the year, but it vanishes on accommodation
Jul 14, 2017, 4:08 PM
George Hughes

I get by on student loan and my busking 😂
Jul 14, 2017, 4:07 PM
Callum Davies
I know, I'll try to do that. I may have too much, if anything! 😛 What're you currently living on, if you don't mind my asking?
Jul 14, 2017, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
You'll be living at home, so just watch where you spend, make a budget each week etc
Jul 14, 2017, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
I just hope I can make it last
Jul 14, 2017, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
Wow, you're doing well :p
Jul 14, 2017, 4:05 PM
Callum Davies
With the grant as well (£4,750) should be about £15,000 in the account by the time I resign on 25th August
Jul 14, 2017, 4:04 PM
George Hughes
Ahh, good stuff 😁
Jul 14, 2017, 4:03 PM

Could be, but the family who invited my were saying that it was a lot more expensive than last time. But they usually go in September time so could be that
Jul 14, 2017, 3:44 PM
Callum Davies
Is that true? I never heard that. Is this since trump's presidency?
Jul 14, 2017, 3:43 PM

Don't worry I had a giggle to myself 😛 Yep, it won't last long, food prices have risen a lot over there
Jul 14, 2017, 3:42 PM

Just please don't go using the Borderlands chat to troll him. If you want to do that, add him back into the random bollocks chat, and troll him there!

Yeah, we need to keep doing that, it's fun 😆
May 29, 2017, 12:19 AM

May 23, 2017, 6:25 PM

I am not, but I seem to have developed emotions. I feel bad if I ignore her. I feel bad for her if I make her feel bad.

What's happening to me!?😨

I always say the Beatles are a test of music. Like how the shop Next is a test of the health of the high Street. Ie, if next ever goes out of business, that's basically the death of the high Street, if we ever forget the Beatles, music is dead.

Can we hold off til 9? Been staring at screens all day plus gotta eat once I'm back
May 17, 2017, 7:57 PM
Callum Davies
Borderlands?
May 17, 2017, 7:55 PM
Callum Davies
I'm sure you're right
May 17, 2017, 8:13 AM
George Hughes
You can try it on your computer, I might have put something wrong but it said no tickets available
May 16, 2017, 10:19 PM
George Hughes
Aye apparently they're popular here 😆
May 16, 2017, 10:19 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, damn. Everybody wants to see the Kraftwerk comeback tour! 😛
May 16, 2017, 9:25 PM
George Hughes
Think it's sold out
May 16, 2017, 9:20 PM
George Hughes
Not sure
May 16, 2017, 9:20 PM
Callum Davies
How much are tickets?
May 16, 2017, 9:15 PM
George Hughes
Nor did I, I'd enjoy going if you were up for it
May 16, 2017, 8:45 PM
Callum Davies
I didn't know they still gigged, to be perfectly honest with you.
May 16, 2017, 8:16 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, don't know how much tickets are, though. Just thought you might like to go.
May 16, 2017, 8:16 PM
George Hughes
Ooh looks neat

Should be, got an exam tomorrow and the day after but it'll be a good way to take a break for an hour or two
May 16, 2017, 3:22 PM
Callum Davies
Are you still good for Borderlands 8:00 tomorrow?
May 16, 2017, 3:15 PM
George Hughes
Actually worth checking out 😂
May 16, 2017, 1:05 PM
George Hughes
A band
May 16, 2017, 1:05 PM
Callum Davies
What's lonely island? No, wait, I don't think I want to know, do I?
May 16, 2017, 12:23 PM
George Hughes
Oh wait cause lonely island
May 16, 2017, 11:22 AM
George Hughes
Wtf I search for lonely in gifs and it comes up with jizz in my pants
May 16, 2017, 11:22 AM
George Hughes
😆
May 16, 2017, 11:21 AM
George Hughes
Maybe appreciate is a better word
May 16, 2017, 11:21 AM
George Hughes
You enjoy these kind of things more when you're alone I think
May 16, 2017, 11:20 AM
Callum Davies

May 16, 2017, 11:06 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh, I was alone.
May 16, 2017, 11:05 AM
George Hughes
Yeah I usually do but I watched with my sister so we probably chatted over that part 😂
May 16, 2017, 11:04 AM
Callum Davies
The doctor says it in the episode! That's why I watch with subtitles, to never miss a line of dialogue
May 16, 2017, 11:04 AM
George Hughes
Oh shit that would make sense
May 16, 2017, 11:03 AM
Callum Davies
They were killing people. Bill's suit just didn't have enough battery to deliver a lethal dose. But the rest were legitimate corpses
May 16, 2017, 11:00 AM
George Hughes
But this season, every episode's enemy gets their justification. I guess the most recent one not so much, but it turned out they were just capitalist robots and they weren't even killing anyone
May 16, 2017, 10:59 AM
Callum Davies
Hmm, well they've had 'enemies' like that from the David Tennant era, possibly even the Chris Eccelson era. I can't really say for classic Who, I'm not too familiar with that
May 16, 2017, 10:54 AM
George Hughes
I guess. Also, do you like the fact that it shows the enemy from their perspective and they all turn out to essentially be the good guys? I believe that's new to doctor who
May 16, 2017, 10:49 AM
Callum Davies
Yes, if it does get fixed in the next regeneration, that is. I mean, it seems like that's what would happen
May 16, 2017, 8:00 AM
George Hughes
He might be blind for the rest of this series which would be intriguing
May 15, 2017, 10:26 PM
Callum Davies
Peter Capaldi has said this is his last series, and I'm assuming they're carrying on the series, as opposed to just stopping it altogether! Or at least, I really hope so! 😥
May 15, 2017, 10:21 PM
Callum Davies
Very interested to see where they'll go with this one. Do you think it'll be permanent? Surely it'll get fixed in the next regeneration, which is the end of this series
May 15, 2017, 10:17 PM
George Hughes
That face says it all.. very strange turn
May 15, 2017, 10:15 PM
Callum Davies
Just watched Dr Who 😯
May 15, 2017, 10:04 PM
George Hughes
Let me know when you do, there is much to discuss 😝
May 15, 2017, 1:08 PM
Callum Davies
Not yet. No spoilers!
May 15, 2017, 1:04 PM
George Hughes
Have you seen the newest doctor who yet?
May 15, 2017, 12:25 PM
George Hughes
I shall see you at 7, enjoy your feeding
May 13, 2017, 5:35 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, well I'm going to feed myself, but I'll see you later
May 13, 2017, 5:35 PM
George Hughes
Yeah sounds good, water on tap?! Sounds like paradise
May 13, 2017, 5:34 PM
Callum Davies
So I'll pick you up at about 7:00?
May 13, 2017, 5:33 PM
Callum Davies
And I'll obviously still be able to drive you home at the end of we're not drinking, so that's good for your family who I'm sure are eager to see you
May 13, 2017, 5:33 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, do you just want to hang out at mine then? I was going to suggest pub, but we've got water on orange juice here! In fact, we've got water on tap!
May 13, 2017, 5:31 PM
George Hughes
I forgot, every day but today has been amazing
May 13, 2017, 5:31 PM
Callum Davies
It'll be freezing!
May 13, 2017, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
May 13, 2017, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
Oh shit yeah
May 13, 2017, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
Have you seen the weather!?
May 13, 2017, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
No idea what else there is tho
May 13, 2017, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
Just because we're not drinking doesn't mean we can't still have fun 😉
May 13, 2017, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
The inch might be kinda cool to wander round haha
May 13, 2017, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
I understand. Unless you know a good place in Perth?
May 13, 2017, 5:29 PM
George Hughes
I don't mind, yours might be better tbh if you don't mind driving me. Mum needs quiet atm
May 13, 2017, 5:28 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, if you're not having any, then I won't either. Can still hang out though, like you say. Yours or mine?
May 13, 2017, 5:27 PM
George Hughes
Pub and crash over summer tho 😎
May 13, 2017, 5:26 PM
George Hughes
Got a band rehearsal tomorrow, plus I'm staying clear of alcohol for a while 😝 I wouldn't mind hanging out and chatting somewhere for a couple hours
May 13, 2017, 5:26 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not planning on having too much, but two or three is still too much for me to drive you home
May 13, 2017, 5:25 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, well if you'd like we could do a pub-and-crash (not a real word, I know. But damn it, I want it to be!) again​ round here?
May 13, 2017, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
Monday probs, I'm free this evening tho
May 13, 2017, 5:23 PM
Callum Davies
Oh I see. Well, when do you need to be back to uni?
May 13, 2017, 5:22 PM
George Hughes
My phone is dead lol
May 13, 2017, 5:21 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, can I call you really quick? Just to sort out
May 13, 2017, 5:21 PM
George Hughes
Come over after dinner at some point?
May 13, 2017, 5:20 PM
George Hughes
Soz ended up not going cause the weather, been drawing with my sister and helping her with her English talk all day lol
May 13, 2017, 5:20 PM
Callum Davies
Do you know when you're back yet?
May 13, 2017, 4:59 PM
George Hughes
Yeah fair do's😆
May 13, 2017, 9:47 AM
Callum Davies
Hey, internet's back up now, so I guess you can message me if you want. But I'll more than likely receive it a more quickly if it's a text! 😂
May 13, 2017, 8:13 AM
George Hughes
Neat
May 11, 2017, 5:52 PM
Callum Davies
My one's a Phil Lewis
May 11, 2017, 5:46 PM
George Hughes
That's the one I was using for a while
May 11, 2017, 4:58 PM
George Hughes

May 11, 2017, 4:58 PM
George Hughes
Simon Haiduk right?
May 11, 2017, 4:55 PM
Callum Davies

May 11, 2017, 4:39 PM
Callum Davies
Simply astounding. This has got to be my favourite ever wallpaper I've had. And there's so many more stored away if I ever get bored of that one. Although I can't see that happening anytime soon!
May 11, 2017, 4:39 PM
George Hughes
Look up either Phil Lewis or Simon Haiduk, psychedelic art is amazing eh 🌈
May 11, 2017, 4:10 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, I'm looking for a new wallpapers for my phone and maybe my laptop. Who was that artist you showed me? I loved his stuff. All the backgrounds I could find were so muted and monochromatic. His work is such a rare celebration of colour and vibrancy!
May 11, 2017, 4:08 PM
George Hughes
I'm around a lot of summer anyways
May 11, 2017, 12:17 PM
George Hughes
No worries
May 11, 2017, 12:17 PM
Callum Davies

May 11, 2017, 11:08 AM
Callum Davies
As you can see, Saturday isn't going to be too great for me after all. Sorry
May 11, 2017, 11:08 AM
George Hughes
Okay dokey 😎
May 11, 2017, 9:56 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh, I see. Well, I think my shifts arrive tonight, so I'll let you know later if I'm free Saturday
May 11, 2017, 9:55 AM
George Hughes
Just chilling with family, meadow is going away next week so last chance to see her this weekend
May 11, 2017, 9:55 AM
Callum Davies
What's happening tonight then? Do tell, do tell
May 11, 2017, 9:54 AM
George Hughes
I'm free for a bit on Saturday I think
May 11, 2017, 9:53 AM
Callum Davies
Doing anything?
May 11, 2017, 9:53 AM
George Hughes
Not yet, got an exam then going back to Perth this afternoon
May 11, 2017, 9:53 AM
Callum Davies
You're in Perth!?

George Hughes
Yay don't we all love early mornings. I genuinely do, not sarcasm, makes for a wonderful day 😝 alright night night man
May 6, 2017, 10:05 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, I'm going to go to bed now. Got to be up @ 5.00am tomorrow. Fun!
May 6, 2017, 10:04 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I know 😝
May 6, 2017, 10:04 PM
Callum Davies
I mean got it right first time
May 6, 2017, 10:03 PM
George Hughes
Well you did say both 😆
May 6, 2017, 10:03 PM
Callum Davies
woo hoo. got it right
May 6, 2017, 10:03 PM
George Hughes
Less than ;)
May 6, 2017, 10:03 PM
George Hughes
One cannot compare slutty demons to why not
May 6, 2017, 10:03 PM
Callum Davies
I always get them mixed up
May 6, 2017, 10:02 PM
Callum Davies
or is that greater than?
May 6, 2017, 10:02 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha self deprecation woo
May 6, 2017, 10:02 PM
Callum Davies
slutty demon is less than why not
May 6, 2017, 10:02 PM
George Hughes
Just like all my music
May 6, 2017, 10:02 PM
Callum Davies
Wrong key
May 6, 2017, 10:02 PM
Callum Davies
My costume this year will be slutty demon< why not?
May 6, 2017, 10:01 PM
George Hughes
That's the spirit 😆
May 6, 2017, 10:01 PM
George Hughes
I mean cliché
May 6, 2017, 10:01 PM
Callum Davies
Plus, why do I need to put a shirt on for halowwen? if women are allowed to dress like sluts than so am I!
May 6, 2017, 10:01 PM
Callum Davies
peeps dress up for comiccon
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
Touché
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
And that's comic-con you're thinking of
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
😎
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
Halloween then, but stick a white shirt on underneath
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
I'm rocking the side part now
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
Ahh
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
Don't people usually dress up for that kind of thing?
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
Got in cut, remember
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
And I'd need to grow my hair back out
May 6, 2017, 10:00 PM
Callum Davies
1) It's not that kind of con 2) I'm pretty sure I'd not be allowed in without a shirt out
May 6, 2017, 9:59 PM
George Hughes
Give me one reason why not
May 6, 2017, 9:59 PM
George Hughes
Fuck it why not 💁‍♂️
May 6, 2017, 9:59 PM
Callum Davies
You want me to rock up to Coxcon as Dante?
May 6, 2017, 9:59 PM
George Hughes
Something to work towards then 😉
May 6, 2017, 9:58 PM
Callum Davies
I've got the hair, though
May 6, 2017, 9:58 PM
Callum Davies
I'd need to do loads of crunches 😂
May 6, 2017, 9:58 PM
Callum Davies
Yes, he is named after the Tuscan poet. Because his brother is named Virgil, the name of the poet who guides Dante through the nine circles of hell in the Inferno section of The Divine Comedy.
May 6, 2017, 9:58 PM
George Hughes
Idea for Halloween?
May 6, 2017, 9:57 PM
George Hughes
Holy shit you need to do this, you could pull that off
May 6, 2017, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
It's Dante from Devil May Cry games
May 6, 2017, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
now there's a proper demon
May 6, 2017, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies

May 6, 2017, 9:56 PM
George Hughes
What an absolute roast
May 6, 2017, 9:55 PM
Callum Davies
let me get a proper demon
May 6, 2017, 9:55 PM
George Hughes
Yep
May 6, 2017, 9:55 PM
Callum Davies
yup
May 6, 2017, 9:55 PM
Callum Davies

May 6, 2017, 9:55 PM
George Hughes
Is this the Amazon licifer?
May 6, 2017, 9:54 PM
Callum Davies
let me get the pic
May 6, 2017, 9:54 PM
George Hughes
Stick it on your bucket list
May 6, 2017, 9:54 PM
Callum Davies
But not this guy, he's a prick
May 6, 2017, 9:54 PM
George Hughes
And dye your hair the whitest white.. oh wait 😆
May 6, 2017, 9:53 PM
Callum Davies
Just waltzing around as Lucifer
May 6, 2017, 9:53 PM
Callum Davies
I shall find my darkest, reddest cape!
May 6, 2017, 9:53 PM
George Hughes
Being dressed up will help cause it doesn't feel as much like it's you that's doing it
May 6, 2017, 9:53 PM
George Hughes
Style yourself as some sort of lucifer and see how many chicks you can pull 😆
May 6, 2017, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
I mean they do love a bad boy 😏
May 6, 2017, 9:52 PM
Callum Davies
50/50
May 6, 2017, 9:51 PM
Callum Davies
Cuz chick dig Lucifer! I haven't worked out if that's a joke or not yet
May 6, 2017, 9:51 PM
George Hughes
Can't hurt can it?
May 6, 2017, 9:50 PM
George Hughes
Put on some make up to make your face even paler, and try it 😂
May 6, 2017, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moonlight? Would you like to" and smile. ALL HAIL LUCIFER
May 6, 2017, 9:49 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yeah, but I've never even been close to that level of crazy.
May 6, 2017, 9:49 PM
George Hughes
Doesn't need to be amazing. You must have told a story in your past and exaggerated details to make it more amusing
May 6, 2017, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
I have no anecdote! I wouln't even be able to make one up! I'm boring, remember?
May 6, 2017, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
I am, but I have zero expectations from it 😆 I occasionally go on it for some existential chats or quality discussions
May 6, 2017, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Or just say some weird shit: Have you ever found yourself in a different country with no idea how you got there? Then tell her some anecdote about drinking in Edinburgh and ending up at the airport in France with no recollection
May 6, 2017, 9:45 PM
Callum Davies
So are you still using Tinder then?
May 6, 2017, 9:44 PM
Callum Davies
"I think you dropped something. Your standards. Hi, I'm Callum" 😂
May 6, 2017, 9:43 PM
George Hughes
I mean like getting numbers 😂 you'll be with Kyle most of the time anyways 😂😂
May 6, 2017, 9:42 PM
Callum Davies
Kyle and I are sharing a twin room...
May 6, 2017, 9:41 PM
George Hughes
Doesn't matter if you mess up with a girl there, just practise bud 😆
May 6, 2017, 9:41 PM
Callum Davies
Nerd3
May 6, 2017, 9:41 PM
Callum Davies
The only person I want to meet is Nerd£
May 6, 2017, 9:41 PM
George Hughes
Practise your pick up lines
May 6, 2017, 9:41 PM
Callum Davies
In Telford? Long distance man
May 6, 2017, 9:40 PM
George Hughes
You never know 😆
May 6, 2017, 9:40 PM
George Hughes
You might meet someone at coxcon
May 6, 2017, 9:40 PM
Callum Davies
😂
May 6, 2017, 9:40 PM
George Hughes
That too
May 6, 2017, 9:40 PM
Callum Davies
Pretty smart for a hot girl
May 6, 2017, 9:40 PM
Callum Davies
Yup ;)
May 6, 2017, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
She's pretty hot for a smart girl
May 6, 2017, 9:39 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh. Anyway, you don't want to be going into college already having been spoken for.
May 6, 2017, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
It goes without saying 😄
May 6, 2017, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
She was a clever bean, I think she was in my ah maths class.
May 6, 2017, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
Obviously, it goes without saying that this stays between you and I?
May 6, 2017, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
She always seemed like one of the more popular types
May 6, 2017, 9:37 PM
Callum Davies
Funny. I never had Katy down as that sort during school
May 6, 2017, 9:37 PM
Callum Davies
So am I to assume that you have since retired the ol' Tinder?
May 6, 2017, 9:36 PM
George Hughes
Gotta be a right speccy for a chick like her
May 6, 2017, 9:36 PM
Callum Davies
Complex numbers? OH, nerdy. Got cha. Took me a second. I'm tired, alright!
May 6, 2017, 9:35 PM
George Hughes
Pm her with some nombres complexes
May 6, 2017, 9:35 PM
Callum Davies
And that would have been one hell of an awkward convo
May 6, 2017, 9:34 PM
Callum Davies
I wonder
May 6, 2017, 9:34 PM
Callum Davies
She had an awesome bio. Something like "Skyrim and LOTR (Lord of the Rings). Talk nerdy to me!" How was I to know THAT was Katy?!
May 6, 2017, 9:34 PM
George Hughes
I wonder how Kyle is getting on with tinder
May 6, 2017, 9:33 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry, it may have saved you an awkward conversation 😂
May 6, 2017, 9:33 PM
Callum Davies
Not going to answer that...Ah well, college soon
May 6, 2017, 9:32 PM
George Hughes
Go find her insta and slide into her DMs
May 6, 2017, 9:32 PM
Callum Davies
I panicked
May 6, 2017, 9:32 PM
Callum Davies
I should have
May 6, 2017, 9:32 PM
Callum Davies
Ah well, naught I can do now, can I. Deleted the damn thing, haven't I?
May 6, 2017, 9:32 PM
George Hughes
Coulda stuck around to find out 😏
May 6, 2017, 9:31 PM
Callum Davies
What I'm wondering is, why in the nine hells did she match with me? I mean, I obviously super liked her, but why did she choose to match back? Maybe she's gone mad...
May 6, 2017, 9:31 PM
George Hughes

May 6, 2017, 9:31 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
May 6, 2017, 9:31 PM
Callum Davies
I was just about to say "OKay then, George" as in George Tekai, but that wouldn't really work with you! 😂
May 6, 2017, 9:30 PM
George Hughes
She works in the cex shop? Oh my
May 6, 2017, 9:29 PM
Callum Davies
According to Facebook/Tinder
May 6, 2017, 9:29 PM
Callum Davies
And she's now working in CeX
May 6, 2017, 9:29 PM
George Hughes
You'll feel better for not having it
May 6, 2017, 9:29 PM
Callum Davies
Was taking too much of my time
May 6, 2017, 9:29 PM
Callum Davies
I was thinking about it anyway
May 6, 2017, 9:28 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha
May 6, 2017, 9:28 PM
George Hughes
Last I heard of her, she was working in markies
May 6, 2017, 9:28 PM
Callum Davies
So I may have deleted Tinder
May 6, 2017, 9:28 PM
Callum Davies
I didn't realise!
May 6, 2017, 9:28 PM
George Hughes
Nae way 😆
May 6, 2017, 9:28 PM
Callum Davies
It's fucking Katy O'Connor!
May 6, 2017, 9:28 PM
Callum Davies
Seems familiar, thinks I
May 6, 2017, 9:27 PM
George Hughes
Neat
May 6, 2017, 9:27 PM
Callum Davies
Comes back as a match
May 6, 2017, 9:27 PM
Callum Davies
Yup. Well, I'm scrolling through, as you do. Come across this really good profile, like the sound of it, so I give it a super like. Nice girl, Katy, 6 miles away.

Only use it if you don't give a flying fuck 🙄
May 6, 2017, 9:27 PM
George Hughes
Causes constant low self esteem and depressed moods

Tinder sucks balllss
May 6, 2017, 9:26 PM
Callum Davies
Well, you know Tinder...
May 6, 2017, 9:26 PM
Callum Davies
Wouldn't mind if you were, just asking
May 6, 2017, 9:25 PM
George Hughes
Why assume I'm high? 😝😂
May 6, 2017, 9:25 PM
George Hughes
Nope, just thought that'd be slightly amusing
May 6, 2017, 9:25 PM
Callum Davies
You high?
May 6, 2017, 9:25 PM
George Hughes
What's up?
May 6, 2017, 9:25 PM
George Hughes
Meeee sideways
May 6, 2017, 9:24 PM
Callum Davies
Fuuuuuuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
May 6, 2017, 9:24 PM
Callum Davies
Hello?
May 2, 2017, 8:09 PM
George Hughes
It appealed to my quiet nature
Apr 27, 2017, 1:27 PM
George Hughes
That was a beautiful composition, I loved it
Apr 27, 2017, 1:26 PM
Callum Davies
But John Cage is a genuine composer.
Apr 27, 2017, 1:20 PM
George Hughes
Thought it might be xD
Apr 27, 2017, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
Yup. There's sheet music if you're​ having trouble playing it. It's all rests
Apr 27, 2017, 1:19 PM
George Hughes
Is it gonna be silence for 4 minutes?
Apr 27, 2017, 1:17 PM
Callum Davies
Look up John Cage's 4'33". It's a genuine piece of music
Apr 27, 2017, 12:21 PM
Callum Davies
I really must stop
This obsession with haiku
Oh fuck, not again
Apr 27, 2017, 11:37 AM
Callum Davies
Don't you love being
Schizophrenic, it feel good
...
What you say my Mum!?😡
Apr 27, 2017, 11:36 AM
Callum Davies
Why are haikus hard?
You only have so many
Words. Shit, out again!
Apr 27, 2017, 11:11 AM
Callum Davies
Writing a haiku
This is the second line now
Shit, ran out of words
Apr 27, 2017, 11:10 AM
George Hughes
OMG You won't believe this theory about quantum physics 😮😮😍👌🏼👌🏼 @ Buzzfeed.com
https://www.buzzfeed.com/
Apr 26, 2017, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
🤔😮
Apr 26, 2017, 6:55 PM
George Hughes
Nobody knows.. but it could be linked to consciousness since the act of observing the particle changes its behaviour
Apr 26, 2017, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
And nobody knows why it is. They know it happens, but not why. Oh, quantum physics! 😏
Apr 26, 2017, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
And also what you said but the quantum physics bit is the cool part
Apr 26, 2017, 6:52 PM
George Hughes
Nothing proves anything.. but kinda, it shows particles acting as a wave
Apr 26, 2017, 6:52 PM
Callum Davies
That's the one that proves photons act as both a particle and a wave, isn't it?
Apr 26, 2017, 6:51 PM
George Hughes
You know the double slit experiment?
Apr 26, 2017, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
So did the atoms
Apr 26, 2017, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, I'm pretty sure i just made them up. But they SOUND real
Apr 26, 2017, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
The man's a genius
Apr 26, 2017, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
😮😮
Apr 26, 2017, 6:48 PM
Callum Davies
Quantum air pockets?
Apr 26, 2017, 6:47 PM
George Hughes
I want to know how they'd cook it cause how do you inflate an atom-thick substance? 🤔
Apr 26, 2017, 6:47 PM
Callum Davies
Thanks. You know they're developing spaghetti that's just 1 atom thick. Spaghethene, I think they're calling it
Apr 26, 2017, 6:30 PM
George Hughes
Sure thing, I'll drop him a line of spag
Apr 26, 2017, 4:10 PM
George Hughes
It goes off after a week, but quantam spaghetti is the future
Apr 26, 2017, 4:10 PM
Callum Davies
Also, can you drop Euan a message on Steam sometime today to tell him bout playing Borderlands tomorrow night?
Apr 26, 2017, 3:58 PM
Callum Davies
But if you keep spaghetti for 200 years, won't it go off?
Apr 26, 2017, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
But science is all about keeping an open mind, and also spaghetti
Apr 26, 2017, 3:21 PM
Callum Davies
Then again, that's a big if. I'm not saying the split universe theory isn't correct, I'm just saying at one point in history it was considered common knowledge that the earth was flat. Maybe in 200-odd years time, if the human race still exists, people will look back on us as laugh at string theory. "Those silly humans" they will say "how could they not have known that atoms are actually all connected with an infinitely long strand of spaghetti, and that the universe is in fact just one massive plate of spaghetti Bolognese" and that's why I'm not winning a Nobel prize anytime soon
Apr 26, 2017, 2:31 PM
George Hughes
Logic! 😎
Apr 26, 2017, 1:26 PM
George Hughes
That would make sense, however if each key pressed is random and the split universe theory is correct, there would be a universe where the monkey succeeds
Apr 26, 2017, 1:26 PM
Callum Davies
Brainiac tested that theory, and worked out that whilst true, at the rate their monkeys were going, the inevitable heat death of the universe would happen before
Apr 26, 2017, 12:09 PM
George Hughes
A monkey at a typewriter will eventually write the works of Shakespeare ;)
Apr 26, 2017, 11:55 AM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, that's actually an infinitely better answer than i was expecting. Just to clarify; that's not to say that i was expecting a bad answer from you, per se, but damn if that isn't some good life advice!
Apr 26, 2017, 7:46 AM
George Hughes
Cheesy grin :P Looking smart, but don't validate your opinion of yourself with someone else's, that can cause self-confidence to suffer, there's some handy life advice ;)
Apr 25, 2017, 8:57 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 25, 2017, 5:43 PM
Callum Davies
Felt particularly well dressed and attractive today, decided to shoot this. Can you give me your photographic opinion? I just thought I'd just as well show SOMEBODY! 😂
Apr 25, 2017, 5:43 PM
George Hughes
Mum put on a movie anyways 💁🏼
Apr 18, 2017, 9:04 PM
Callum Davies
I'm watching Sherlock with the family now, sorry 😕
Apr 18, 2017, 8:20 PM
George Hughes
I'll let you know what time I'm able to play then 😄
Apr 18, 2017, 6:26 PM
Callum Davies
Can't do that. I'm in bed by then. Jesus, don't you sleep?
Apr 18, 2017, 1:42 PM
George Hughes
make it like half 10ish?
Apr 18, 2017, 12:35 PM
George Hughes
I think so yeah
Apr 18, 2017, 12:35 PM
Callum Davies
Are you free to play Borderlands tonight? If so, I'll hit Euan up on Steam.
Apr 18, 2017, 12:15 PM
Callum Davies
I suspected as much. Wanna listen to some good old gangsta rap (clipping.) on the way?
Apr 14, 2017, 6:42 PM
George Hughes
We're just gonna meet Kyle there cause he's gonna be walking in the village
Apr 14, 2017, 6:38 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, and I'll be able to take you and Kyle there now, given I'm not drinking
Apr 14, 2017, 6:36 PM
Callum Davies
I feel kinda bad if that is what happened. Anyway, not much i can about it now, if she's now cut off the only communication with her i had. Ah well, plenty to talk about at the pub, eh?
Apr 14, 2017, 6:35 PM
George Hughes
Oh dear xD some miscommunication there.. always get them on messenger ;)
Apr 14, 2017, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
It came up when i turned my WiFi back on with "Charlotte has liked your message" and so I thought she might have left one in reply. When i boot Tinder up, she's gone from my matches list. Maybe she thought I ditched her! Silly moo! 😂
Apr 14, 2017, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
Indeed there are plenty of water based lifeforms living within the confines of the ocean
Apr 14, 2017, 6:29 PM
George Hughes
Weird how she chooses to unmatch after the "meetup"
Apr 14, 2017, 6:29 PM
Callum Davies
She unmatched me on Tinder! 😂 What did she expect? Keep me wait 45mins. Ah well, plenty of aquatic creatures
Apr 14, 2017, 6:29 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, guess what
Apr 14, 2017, 6:27 PM
George Hughes
Ahh some situations it would make sense, but the cost of owning the car just wouldn't be worth it in every day life for a lot of people
Apr 14, 2017, 4:38 PM
Callum Davies
Buses, maybe. Trains, I'd say that's debatable. That's why Kyle and I are driving down to Telford for CoxCon. We looked it up, and a train ticket for one of us would be double what it would cost in fuel to get the both of us there
Apr 14, 2017, 4:08 PM
George Hughes
Nahh, buses and trains are far more affordable
Apr 14, 2017, 4:07 PM
Callum Davies
Surely a car is close to a necessity in this modern age?
Apr 14, 2017, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
Second hand, of course
Apr 14, 2017, 4:06 PM
George Hughes
I'm not spending that much on a luxury
Apr 14, 2017, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
I got mine for £1,200
Apr 14, 2017, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
Most likely yeh, plus buying the actual car is way beyond the amount of money I'll ever see in the near future
Apr 14, 2017, 4:05 PM
Callum Davies
Yup, i bet fuel is getting close to £1.20/litre over there. At Morrison's in Perth it's £1.13/litre, just for a comparison
Apr 14, 2017, 4:03 PM
George Hughes
I mean even if I did decided to spend a load of money on lessons and a test and get my license, the cost of having a car in Edinburgh is so much compared how little use it would be 💁🏼
Apr 14, 2017, 4:02 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, THAT'S why you don't drive. It wouldn't have anything to do with the fact you don't actually have a license and therefore would be illegal to drive
Apr 14, 2017, 4:00 PM
George Hughes
💵💵💵
Apr 14, 2017, 3:46 PM
George Hughes
And I don't drive
Apr 14, 2017, 3:44 PM
George Hughes
That's why I get a student loan
Apr 14, 2017, 3:43 PM
George Hughes
Ouch :'(
Apr 14, 2017, 3:43 PM
Callum Davies
It's been going to a separate account for college, minus car insurance once a month and fuel when i need it. Haven't seen a penny of it since i started
Apr 14, 2017, 3:36 PM
Callum Davies
Spending???😕 What's that?
Apr 14, 2017, 3:35 PM
George Hughes
Any raise is good tho
Apr 14, 2017, 3:34 PM
George Hughes
How have you been spending so much? I thought wth working as much as you are, you'd be pretty comfortable 😝
Apr 14, 2017, 3:34 PM
Callum Davies
But, i guess that's an extra £1 every 6 hours, and i work 42-44 hours a week, so i guess it kinds makes a difference if you scale it up
Apr 14, 2017, 3:31 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, so is mine. That's why i accepted the shifts for tomorrow. Although saying that, i did get a raise. Up from £6.95/hour to £7.05/hours. A whole 10p! Lucky me! 😂
Apr 14, 2017, 3:30 PM
George Hughes
Don't apologise, it'll be good craic, I might not have much either, my bank is struggling rn
Apr 14, 2017, 3:28 PM
Callum Davies
Sorry. I'll still hang out. I just won't drink. Tasty orange juice! 😋
Apr 14, 2017, 3:26 PM
George Hughes
Aw okay
Apr 14, 2017, 3:14 PM
Callum Davies
Well, i cant now. Got work tomorrow
Apr 14, 2017, 3:02 PM
George Hughes
As they always say, see how you feel after a few drinks 😝😂
Apr 14, 2017, 2:58 PM
Callum Davies
If your sure; I'll see how i feel at the time
Apr 14, 2017, 2:57 PM
George Hughes
Up to you, we wouldn't mind having you tho :p
Apr 14, 2017, 2:56 PM
Callum Davies
I dunno, i may not drink. I've been trying to give up, and i wouldn't want to be a burden upon your family
Apr 14, 2017, 2:35 PM
George Hughes
😝😂
Apr 14, 2017, 1:49 PM
George Hughes
C U @ 7
Apr 14, 2017, 1:49 PM
Callum Davies
I'll see you @ 7 then.
Apr 14, 2017, 1:49 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers.
Apr 14, 2017, 1:48 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's cool
Apr 14, 2017, 1:48 PM
Callum Davies
I'm drinking, remember?
Apr 14, 2017, 1:48 PM
Callum Davies
But I'll need to leave it at yours.
Apr 14, 2017, 1:48 PM
George Hughes
Yeah come by mine at 7 and we can go down and get Kyle
Apr 14, 2017, 1:48 PM
Callum Davies
Because if I'm drinking I'm going to have to leave my car at yours
Apr 14, 2017, 1:47 PM
Callum Davies
It could be a perfectly legitimate excuse. When i leave, i shall leave her a polite message, and maybe she'll text me back. If not, these things happen. If your sure; we'll work it out at the time. I'm gonna leave now; can i pick you up at 7:00?
Apr 14, 2017, 1:47 PM
George Hughes
Aw man
Apr 14, 2017, 1:45 PM
George Hughes
You're welcome to chill here tonight yeah 🍻
Apr 14, 2017, 1:45 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, she's a no-show; for sure
Apr 14, 2017, 1:44 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, i think so. I'm afraid i won't be drinking unless i can crash at your place lol 😋
Apr 14, 2017, 1:43 PM
George Hughes
Pool table better be free 😝
Apr 14, 2017, 1:43 PM
George Hughes
Yeah for sure
Apr 14, 2017, 1:43 PM
Callum Davies
You still up for le pub tonight?
Apr 14, 2017, 1:41 PM
Callum Davies
Just looks like a gun on mine
Apr 14, 2017, 1:38 PM
George Hughes
Oh fucking apple
Apr 14, 2017, 1:38 PM
Callum Davies
Not on my one it's not. Apparently apple censors it's emojis
Apr 14, 2017, 1:37 PM
George Hughes
Ain't no gun
Apr 14, 2017, 1:37 PM
George Hughes
Lime green
Apr 14, 2017, 1:37 PM
George Hughes
It's green with a red nozzle
Apr 14, 2017, 1:37 PM
Callum Davies
No, it's a gun. I'd have thought you'd watched enough action movies to realise that
Apr 14, 2017, 1:37 PM
George Hughes
Is that a fucking water pistol
Apr 14, 2017, 1:36 PM
Callum Davies
He he, 😁🔫
Apr 14, 2017, 1:35 PM
George Hughes
Always get their numbers and facebooks before meeting them
Apr 14, 2017, 1:35 PM
George Hughes
Welp
Apr 14, 2017, 1:34 PM
Callum Davies
Well she's not answered the first message
Apr 14, 2017, 1:34 PM
George Hughes
☀️😝
Apr 14, 2017, 1:34 PM
George Hughes
Tell her there should be a blinding light source in the centre of the room
Apr 14, 2017, 1:34 PM
Callum Davies
But what do i do, go up to every woman here and ask her? I think not!
Apr 14, 2017, 1:33 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha that's a possibility
Apr 14, 2017, 1:33 PM
Callum Davies
Ehh, those are the dangers of online dating. I'm just hoping she's not already here and i don't recognise her. Anyway, I've dropped her a message on Tinder
Apr 14, 2017, 1:32 PM
George Hughes
That chicks getting a pounding if she thinks she's standing up my friend 🙄 fingers crossed bro
Apr 14, 2017, 1:31 PM
Callum Davies
I'll wait till 2 at the latest, then I'm off
Apr 14, 2017, 1:30 PM
Callum Davies
Nope
Apr 14, 2017, 1:29 PM
George Hughes
Jeez
Apr 14, 2017, 1:29 PM
George Hughes
Has she messaged you to tell you she's late?
Apr 14, 2017, 1:29 PM
Callum Davies
Yes, but we arranged to meet at 1:00
Apr 14, 2017, 1:29 PM
George Hughes
Wow you did get in early
Apr 14, 2017, 1:29 PM
Callum Davies
There's fashionably late, but Jesus Christ
Apr 14, 2017, 1:29 PM
Callum Davies
Not here yet
Apr 14, 2017, 1:28 PM
Callum Davies
I can talk
Apr 14, 2017, 1:28 PM
George Hughes
Awesome, enjoy 😉
Apr 14, 2017, 1:28 PM
Callum Davies
I will. Just in 'bucks waiting for her now. I drove a little bit quicker than i thought i would
Apr 14, 2017, 12:55 PM
George Hughes
And you can let us know how your date goes 😏
Apr 14, 2017, 12:11 PM
George Hughes
Aw sweet, I'll tell Kyle half 7?
Apr 14, 2017, 12:11 PM
Callum Davies
Hey George, it seems I'm off today. Of course, I'm meeting Charlotte today, but​i reckon i should be free from about 7:00pm onwards.
Apr 14, 2017, 7:39 AM
George Hughes
good point xD
Apr 13, 2017, 6:10 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, will do. So does Euan know about your cancellation?
Apr 13, 2017, 5:54 PM
George Hughes
I'm playing Civ tonight with Nathan soz, let me know if tomorrow is good tho :D
Apr 13, 2017, 5:54 PM
Callum Davies
I said maybe, not for sure. Just bear that in mind. We still on for Borderlands tonight, though?
Apr 13, 2017, 5:52 PM
George Hughes
I'll ask kyle and see if tomorrow evening is okay
Apr 13, 2017, 5:51 PM
Callum Davies
Actually, maybe tomorrow
Apr 13, 2017, 5:49 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck me if i know. My shifts were supposed to arrive today, but nothing's come through yet. Sorry😞
Apr 13, 2017, 5:49 PM
George Hughes
What evenings are you free? Fancy coming to the pub with me and Kyle for some pool next week?
Apr 13, 2017, 5:17 PM
George Hughes
Oh fair enough 😆
Apr 12, 2017, 2:25 PM
Callum Davies
I just came off the app and it found a new person when i started it back up
Apr 12, 2017, 2:24 PM
George Hughes
Huh?
Apr 12, 2017, 2:24 PM
Callum Davies
I didn't do anything
Apr 12, 2017, 2:21 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I've found her on tinder before, send her a meme or something 😂
Apr 12, 2017, 2:20 PM

Not very well 😂
Apr 10, 2017, 9:42 PM

How are you going to code with your fingers crossed?
Apr 10, 2017, 9:41 PM
George Hughes
Semi colons??
Apr 10, 2017, 9:40 PM
Callum Davies
Just as sec, a message hath arrived from yon firestarter
Apr 10, 2017, 9:39 PM
Callum Davies
How are you going to misplace those semi-colons like that?
Apr 10, 2017, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Awesome, my fingers are crossed 😝
Apr 10, 2017, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
Ehh, this Tinder thing might not be as bad as i initially thought, i suppose. 😏 I dunno, she seems nice enough, she seems as eager to meet up with me as i am with her. So, we'll see how it goes 😌
Apr 10, 2017, 9:36 PM
George Hughes
Aw yass! Nice one 😎
Apr 10, 2017, 9:33 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, guess what?

You don't need to, I'm going to tell you

I'm arranging a Tinder date just now. She lives in Perth! 😁
Apr 10, 2017, 8:35 PM
Callum Davies
Like, now?
Apr 8, 2017, 4:29 PM
George Hughes
Hey man that's me back in brig in case you want to meet up sometime soon 😝
Apr 8, 2017, 4:29 PM
George Hughes
I wouldn't blame it on him tho, it's the kind of person he is 💁🏼
Apr 4, 2017, 3:36 PM
Callum Davies
He did start it i guess. And that's what he always does.
Apr 4, 2017, 3:35 PM
George Hughes
I didn't expect him to react, that's the kind of thing I say to everyone when they say rude shtuff to me 😆
Apr 4, 2017, 3:34 PM
Callum Davies
You've got to stop doing that
Apr 4, 2017, 3:33 PM
George Hughes
I said I was feeling tired and euan called me dumb, so I took the piss and said 'I'm not a idiot' 💁🏼 then he deleted the chat 😐
Apr 4, 2017, 3:14 PM
Callum Davies
What happened to the Borderlands group?
Apr 4, 2017, 11:03 AM
Callum Davies
Join Euan and I on Borderlands?
Mar 26, 2017, 8:24 PM

Hey, I've lost some birthdays from my phone, and Kyle being Kyle, doesn't have his on his facebook page. I don't suppose you know it, do you?
Mar 26, 2017, 1:06 PM
George Hughes
Hey man
Mar 26, 2017, 1:05 PM

Come on teamspeak?
Mar 22, 2017, 7:54 PM
George Hughes
All the food I've got takes over an hour to prepare, so I'll just come off earlier
Mar 22, 2017, 7:47 PM
Callum Davies
Alright, I'll see you all @ 8. Imma shove some food in myself too. If Euan comes complaining, tell him I'll be on at 8 as well
Mar 22, 2017, 7:18 PM
George Hughes
Lol nah man, need some tasty food, I'll come on at 8?
Mar 22, 2017, 7:16 PM

Mar 22, 2017, 7:11 PM

Just super liked someone on Tinder because i wanted to find out what the blue star did. Whoops! 😬

It wasn't a space monolith at the beginning of 2001, it was just the next iPhone! 😂
Mar 16, 2017, 1:19 PM
George Hughes
Haha smart phones have grown quite a bit, that's why I like my wee iphone 5s :P
Mar 16, 2017, 1:18 PM
Callum Davies
But for fucks sake, this thing is massive. Who's pockets are they making these phones for!?
Mar 16, 2017, 1:18 PM
George Hughes
I tthink that's what I bought my mum for her birthday
Mar 16, 2017, 1:17 PM
Callum Davies
I changed a letter and added a number. I broke my Motorola Moto X, so now i have a Motorola Moto G4
Mar 16, 2017, 1:17 PM
George Hughes
what kind of phone? :P
Mar 16, 2017, 1:16 PM
George Hughes
Haha cheeky xD
Mar 16, 2017, 1:15 PM
Callum Davies
Got a new phone, didn't I? 😉 It's great. So, blessing in disguise?
Mar 16, 2017, 1:13 PM
George Hughes
You can always fix it with rice if it needs it
Mar 15, 2017, 5:27 PM
George Hughes
Oh shiit, hopefully it's fine 😂
Mar 15, 2017, 5:27 PM
Callum Davies
My god. So i just took my phone with me into the toilet (as you do). Accidentally dropped it. (The toilet was flushed, don't worry). Fished it out immediately after, shoved it in a towel; my phone still seems to be working! Let's hope no fluid seeps into the system
Mar 15, 2017, 8:47 AM
George Hughes
I just want a girl who will drop acid with me, is that too much to ask? 😝

Mar 14, 2017, 8:48 PM

Perfect 👌🏼😂
Mar 14, 2017, 8:48 PM
Callum Davies
Very well, actually. We have a lot in common. We're both evil, calculating, manipulating, nihilistic sociopaths! 🙌
Mar 14, 2017, 8:22 PM
George Hughes
Ooh, how's it going?
Mar 14, 2017, 8:20 PM

Mar 6, 2017, 6:46 PM

Keep them all chatting but only date the ones that are interesting and you'll end up with a favourite 😝
Mar 6, 2017, 6:46 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck me, I think that's 7 now. I'm getting worried. I'm not gonna be able to keep them all happy. Obviously I'll only do stuff with one, but I don't have enough time to go on a date with them all lol!
Mar 6, 2017, 6:45 PM

Another match, her profile started with "Hello, is it me you're looking for" so I've just sent "I can see it in your eyes" 😂

Damn Xallucador be pulling all the ladies
Mar 6, 2017, 6:37 PM
Callum Davies
4, have I died?
Mar 6, 2017, 6:36 PM

Fuck me, that's a third one! What is happening right now?!
Mar 6, 2017, 6:35 PM

An American on holiday, I'm guessing

Awesome :D you'll probs want a controller for it tho
Mar 5, 2017, 9:44 PM
Callum Davies
I'll have to look up the specs, but my laptop should be able to handle it
Mar 5, 2017, 9:44 PM
George Hughes
It's a little dear, just under £14
Mar 5, 2017, 9:43 PM

How much?
Mar 5, 2017, 9:43 PM

Mar 5, 2017, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I love that video/song
Mar 5, 2017, 9:36 PM
Callum Davies
Just watching YouTube. Watching that lil dickie video again. Tis pretty funny
Mar 5, 2017, 9:36 PM

I see the inspiration from Euan coming through
Mar 5, 2017, 4:47 PM
Callum Davies
This is true. I gotta go now, I'm sitting in a car park, and if these people looking at me get any more angry for hogging the spot, they'll spontaneously development lazer vision and incinerate me
Mar 5, 2017, 4:46 PM
George Hughes
But so are payments 😢
Mar 5, 2017, 4:45 PM
Callum Davies
Because ads are poo cake 💩🎂
Mar 5, 2017, 4:44 PM

Why can't they just used ads like any normal company
Mar 5, 2017, 4:42 PM
George Hughes
It used to be unilmited 😢
Mar 5, 2017, 4:42 PM
Callum Davies
I know. I hate how you don't have unlimited swipes. What are they doing, trying to cover the development and maintenance costs of their free app? Selfish bastards!
Mar 5, 2017, 4:41 PM
George Hughes
Aww man 😕 you'll get some soon I'm sure
Mar 5, 2017, 4:40 PM

You're not hideous bro, takes me a while to get any matches at all
Mar 5, 2017, 12:38 PM

No, that's okay(?) I'm really not sure where the line is here. No matches yet. I took the topless pic off, by the way. I'm hedious lol 😖

Mar 3, 2017, 7:31 PM

Okay. I started writing the profile; I've now used all 500 character!
Mar 3, 2017, 7:30 PM

Mar 3, 2017, 6:43 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then. I need to grab some photos from Facebook, as well as some of the other computer.
Mar 3, 2017, 6:42 PM
George Hughes
sepia will be fine
Mar 3, 2017, 6:41 PM
George Hughes
It's more defined in b&w but sepia looks more natural
Mar 3, 2017, 6:41 PM
Callum Davies
Which one do you reckon?
Mar 3, 2017, 6:41 PM
Callum Davies


Mar 3, 2017, 6:41 PM
Callum Davies
I went for sepia tone. I think it looks better. Just a second
Mar 3, 2017, 6:40 PM
George Hughes
b&w filter should do the trick
Mar 3, 2017, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I might slap a filter on that bitch, and hide it in the back of my photos. I'll set up la tinder now
Mar 3, 2017, 6:39 PM
George Hughes
I'm sure it'll be fine tho xD
Mar 3, 2017, 6:38 PM
George Hughes
Well.. :P I guess it's cause you're leaning into it a bit
Mar 3, 2017, 6:38 PM

Mar 3, 2017, 6:37 PM

George Hughes
Yeah get those clothes off boy
Mar 3, 2017, 6:34 PM
Callum Davies
Yup. Well, let's say, I've taken a mirror selfie. Are you comfortable enough with your sexuality to view it purely objectively and give your opinion on the quality of the photo?
Mar 3, 2017, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Does that give you any ideas?
Mar 3, 2017, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
"Hey ladies, anyone want to do drugs with me?"
Mar 3, 2017, 6:29 PM

Mar 3, 2017, 6:29 PM

It just means it narrows it down to folk I'd actually be interested in

Would you mind if I see your pictures your using?
Mar 3, 2017, 6:23 PM

Eh, they might get a pleasent surprise! I don't want to come across as a dick, is all. I'd obviously have it as my last photo
Mar 3, 2017, 6:23 PM

Unless you don't mind 😄
Mar 3, 2017, 6:22 PM

Mar 3, 2017, 6:21 PM
George Hughes
Stick on a vest and do a mirror selfie xD
Mar 3, 2017, 6:21 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I'm not sure about it, but I know some like it. Working at the factory has, let's say, shaped me very pleasingly. And they say if you've got it, flaunt it...
Mar 3, 2017, 6:20 PM
George Hughes
Sure thing :D
Mar 3, 2017, 6:19 PM

So that's the post up now :P
Feb 28, 2017, 7:05 PM

Good plan, but often fb doesn't expose your post to many folk so you'll get fairly limited views
Feb 28, 2017, 6:54 PM
Callum Davies
it'll take 2 secs
Feb 28, 2017, 6:53 PM

just a sec, I'm working on another trump post. May not be as good, but i'm using facebook as joke quality control right now

Better than amber leaf for sure anyways 😂
Feb 19, 2017, 7:16 PM
George Hughes
Indeed it is, and it tastes pretty good as well
Feb 19, 2017, 7:16 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, I'm game for that. It's just tobacco, right?
Feb 19, 2017, 7:15 PM
George Hughes
If you like I can bring my new tobacco (American spirit) and we can try it 😂
Feb 19, 2017, 7:15 PM
Callum Davies
Sitting in my cupboard 😆 oops
Feb 19, 2017, 7:14 PM

I've got plenty of conversation in me anyways so we're good 😝 btw how's the pipe?
Feb 19, 2017, 7:13 PM

Feb 19, 2017, 7:11 PM

Hahaha try remember some craic for next week 😝😂😂
Feb 19, 2017, 7:11 PM

Ahh, we need something to talk about this weekend. Plus I can't be bothered trying to remember
Feb 19, 2017, 7:06 PM
George Hughes
Anything else been happening apart from work? 😝
Feb 19, 2017, 7:03 PM

Count yourself lucky you get paid to excersise😝
Feb 19, 2017, 6:59 PM

Of course 😂😂
Feb 19, 2017, 6:59 PM

Haven't stepped foot in a gym
Feb 19, 2017, 6:49 PM

😂
Feb 19, 2017, 6:48 PM
Callum Davies
There's your answer
Feb 19, 2017, 6:48 PM
Callum Davies
Take off the "out" bit
Feb 19, 2017, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
Whereabouts do you workout?
Feb 19, 2017, 6:48 PM
George Hughes
Not bad at all 😄
Feb 19, 2017, 6:47 PM
Callum Davies
As I say, 5kg one handed, 20kg if I'm using both
Feb 19, 2017, 6:45 PM
George Hughes
Yeah the machines are much easier, I'll get onto the free weights once I'm back to the gym and more comfortable with what I'm doing
Feb 19, 2017, 6:45 PM
George Hughes
Even one handed? ;)
Feb 19, 2017, 6:44 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh I see. I'm talking about free weights. I could probably pull my body weight's worth of resistance on a rowing machine or on some other such device
Feb 19, 2017, 6:43 PM
George Hughes
Only on the resistance machines tho, never did any free weights
Feb 19, 2017, 6:42 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I'm about 8st ~60kg or so
Feb 19, 2017, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
That's pretty damn heavy
Feb 19, 2017, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
You lifted your own body weight? I dunno bout you, but I'm about 8st
Feb 19, 2017, 6:41 PM
George Hughes
I don't really think in pounds tbh, I'm more about dem kilos
Feb 19, 2017, 6:41 PM
Callum Davies
I looked it up
Feb 19, 2017, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies
5kg = ~11lbs
20kg = ~44lbs
Feb 19, 2017, 6:40 PM
George Hughes
That's not bad, I usually had it about my body weight back when I was still doing the resistance machines
Feb 19, 2017, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies
Well, for me, I can lift 5kg on one hand, and 20kg using both. Not amazing, I know, but decent, I'd say. I dunno what those are in lbs; use a fucking converter! 😂
Feb 19, 2017, 6:25 PM
George Hughes
Fun times.. I've not been lifting at all bro, I will get back to the gym soon tho
Feb 19, 2017, 6:21 PM
Callum Davies
Tired, lol. Just come off work. Can I ask, how much are you lifting nowadays? Just wanna compare 😜
Feb 19, 2017, 6:13 PM
George Hughes
You*
Feb 19, 2017, 6:12 PM
George Hughes
Not bad at all, moi?

Feb 14, 2017, 12:18 AM

brilliant! have you got uni for next year sorted out btw?
Feb 14, 2017, 12:18 AM

Oh, I know. I'm looking forward to it. Got ma ticket, booking hotel with Kyle tomorrow
Feb 14, 2017, 12:17 AM

I guess.. it'll be worth it tho, you'll have a blast :D
Feb 14, 2017, 12:16 AM

Work and ironically lack of funds. CoxCon is expensive!
Feb 14, 2017, 12:15 AM

aw man :/ you'll find someone, you been getting out much or is work making that difficult?
Feb 14, 2017, 12:14 AM
Callum Davies
Nah, much to my disappointment 😞
Feb 14, 2017, 12:13 AM
George Hughes
you been seeing anyone btw?
Feb 14, 2017, 12:13 AM
Callum Davies
This is true
Feb 14, 2017, 12:12 AM
George Hughes
none of the above xD unfortunately I've not been that successful but you'll know soon enough ;)
Feb 14, 2017, 12:12 AM
Callum Davies
You've got another girlfriend? A job? You're finally losing your virginity! 😂
Feb 14, 2017, 12:11 AM

if all goes well, it'll be good news :P
Feb 14, 2017, 12:10 AM

Okay...😕
Feb 14, 2017, 12:10 AM

btw remind me to tell you some news when I see you on the 25th :)
Feb 14, 2017, 12:10 AM
Callum Davies
Sure
Feb 13, 2017, 6:40 PM
George Hughes
Can call in 10 mins?
Feb 13, 2017, 6:38 PM
Callum Davies
Never mind, I'll call you tomorrow. What time is good for you?
Feb 13, 2017, 6:35 PM
Callum Davies
In regards to the weekend, that is
Feb 13, 2017, 6:20 PM
Callum Davies
Any chance of a quick ring tonight, so I can let you know what I'm thinking?
Feb 13, 2017, 6:19 PM
Callum Davies
Dude, it's bridge of earn. Traffic isn't really an issue!
Feb 13, 2017, 6:07 PM
George Hughes
Jk midday would maybe be a little easier, even if the traffic will be busier
Feb 13, 2017, 3:44 PM
George Hughes
Sounds good
Feb 13, 2017, 3:43 PM
Callum Davies
Midnight!?
Feb 13, 2017, 3:34 PM
George Hughes
12ish?
Feb 13, 2017, 1:27 PM
Callum Davies
What time do you want me to pick you up at on 25th?
Feb 13, 2017, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
No. And I've just discovered that there is no extra slot. Whereas my old laptop had one 4 gig ram chip inserted with a spare slot. My new laptop has 2 slots also, which have a 4 gig ram chip in each of them. I have 8 gig altogether. So I've got a spare 4 gig ram chip going if you have a spare slot and your laptop uses DDR3 memory
Jan 27, 2017, 8:25 PM
George Hughes
I thought your laptop was just really tiny😆
Jan 27, 2017, 8:22 PM
George Hughes
12gigs is crazy
Jan 27, 2017, 8:22 PM
George Hughes
Ohhh thought you meant storage 😂😂
Jan 27, 2017, 8:22 PM
Callum Davies
Your laptop does not have a terabyte of ram. I don't think a commercial computer exists that has that
Jan 27, 2017, 8:21 PM
George Hughes
Not bad 😆 however my laptop has a terabyte 💁🏼
Jan 27, 2017, 8:16 PM
Callum Davies
I can! 12gb! That's crazy!
Jan 27, 2017, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
I may be able to transfer my 4GB ram chip from the dead laptop to my new 8gb ram laptop. 12 gig!
Jan 27, 2017, 1:10 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that'd work, and plus if you're not gaming on it, you don't need an awful lot of storage anyway
Jan 26, 2017, 1:33 PM
Callum Davies
Only minor thing is that it doesn't have an awful lot of storage. But I'm planning on buying a SATA to USB cable and converting my 500gb HDD that's in my laptop (that still works) into an external hard drive
Jan 26, 2017, 1:27 PM
George Hughes
thought so
Jan 26, 2017, 1:26 PM
Callum Davies
Ps3 controller*
Jan 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
George Hughes
ahh, fair enough xD
Jan 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
Callum Davies
I can use my ps3 on the computer if I wanted to, I just don't PC game much
Jan 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
George Hughes
you could always buy a usb controller
Jan 26, 2017, 1:25 PM
Callum Davies
I work hard, and play hard, with my new powerful laptop! I'm not going to be playing many games though; I don't really like using a keyboard and mouse for games. I much prefer a controller. My ps3 is for games; this is for work and stuff
Jan 26, 2017, 1:24 PM
George Hughes
It's a great way of doing it, a lot more affordable, and impressive that you've paid for it yourself ;)
Jan 26, 2017, 1:22 PM
Callum Davies
Refurbished, but it's basically just a new laptop for a second hand price. They put all new stuff in it and make it as good as new, and I'm not a snob; if it's as good as new, may as well be new for all I'm concerned.
Jan 26, 2017, 1:20 PM
George Hughes
not bad at all, that looks pretty powerful :O

Okay, so you know how I said my laptop was probably dead? Well, I had Euan Reid take a look at it, and the bad news is that it is. BUT, of course, I'm working now, so with a little bit of my wages I bought myself this beast!
Jan 26, 2017, 1:19 PM
George Hughes
Aw no worries, chat later man :)
Jan 22, 2017, 2:00 PM

Anyway, my lunch break is almost over, so I'll have to cut our little conversation off here, I'm afraid. But at least we know I'll get to see you in February. Talk to you soon, bye for now😉
Jan 22, 2017, 1:58 PM
George Hughes
Fun times :O at least you've got a good source of income ;) aw brilliant!!
Jan 22, 2017, 1:57 PM

And that's me got the weekend off 😀
Jan 22, 2017, 1:57 PM
Callum Davies
Life? What's that? All I know now is work! No, but it's pretty good. Also, I've just sent my supervisor the text, so I'll let you know when I have confirmation of my being off at the weekend
Jan 22, 2017, 1:56 PM
George Hughes
How's life?
Jan 22, 2017, 1:53 PM
Callum Davies
As am I 😉
Jan 22, 2017, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
brilliant, I'm looking forward to it :P
Jan 22, 2017, 1:52 PM
Callum Davies
That's loads of notice, thanks so much! If I drop my supervisor a text today, I should almost definitely be able to get the weekend off. We'll arrange details closer to the time, but I'll put the weekend in the calendar and text my supervisor just now
Jan 22, 2017, 1:52 PM
George Hughes
If that suits
Jan 22, 2017, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
February rather
Jan 22, 2017, 1:50 PM
Callum Davies
Of January?
Jan 22, 2017, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
I guess, I might be down on the weekend of the 25th
Jan 22, 2017, 1:49 PM
Callum Davies
Maybe. Work's a bitch. Plus, I'm not sure if I want to be driving in a busy city like Edinburgh yet. When are you next home? That might be easier. Bear in mind I'm driving now, so it's a lot easier for us to meet!
Jan 22, 2017, 1:47 PM

hey man, fancy coming down to edinburgh one weekend soon?

Haha essentially😆 that's pretty good, 4 minors is a safe amount
Jan 10, 2017, 7:19 PM
Callum Davies
I did get 4 minors though. Although they were for hesitation. I'm like the opposite of Toma!
Jan 10, 2017, 7:16 PM
George Hughes
That says it all then 😅😆
Jan 10, 2017, 7:15 PM
Callum Davies
Don't worry, I've PASSED my test!
Jan 10, 2017, 7:15 PM
George Hughes
Great 😆 drive safely tho.. Don't want another Toma on the road
Jan 10, 2017, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
I just need to get it taxed and insured, then I'm good to go 😉
Jan 10, 2017, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
I'm a boy racer, as well, I am. Tearing around Perth in my Toyota Yaris! 😂
Jan 10, 2017, 7:13 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's probably the case 😂
Jan 10, 2017, 7:12 PM
Callum Davies
Well his dad has a Ferrari, doesn't he? Maybe a bad influence!
Jan 10, 2017, 7:11 PM
George Hughes
Nope, but his driving kinda scares me, I was in the car during his lesson a few months back and it was terrifying
Jan 10, 2017, 7:10 PM
Callum Davies
And he's still not driving?
Jan 10, 2017, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
Haha! Toma is on his 5th try at the moment... Not counting the time he forgot to bring his license and couldn't sit it 😂
Jan 10, 2017, 7:10 PM
Callum Davies
Only took 4 tries (!)
Jan 10, 2017, 7:09 PM

you free on friday?
Jan 3, 2017, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
Mum says she'll drop me off at 7 if that's alright
Dec 24, 2016, 10:15 AM
Callum Davies
Sounds alright, just text me when you're nearly here tomorrow
Dec 23, 2016, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
Sounds good, I'll get dropped off around 8ish then? Might need to juggle that cause my family are going for a meal at some point so I'll get dropped off before that
Dec 23, 2016, 7:01 PM
Callum Davies
I suppose. I'll try to talk to them about it tomorrow
Dec 23, 2016, 7:00 PM
George Hughes
So cool that they've accepted my weed smoking 😏 haha fair play but I doubt they'll be against it, it's essentially like having a few whiskeys
Dec 23, 2016, 6:59 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but your parents are cool! 😂 I'm old enough, and it's legal. So they can dislike it all they want, not going to stop me
Dec 23, 2016, 6:58 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha I guess, I mean I told my parents I'm getting you a cigar and we'll be enjoying those tomorrow 😆
Dec 23, 2016, 6:56 PM
Callum Davies
How do you mean? How would you suggest I tell them I'm gonna be smoking a big fat cigar tomorrow?
Dec 23, 2016, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
I might bring a little pot just in case I really feel the need but I doubt I'll touch it
Dec 23, 2016, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
Oh damn 😮 don't be a rebel
Dec 23, 2016, 6:55 PM
Callum Davies
And I've not told mum and/ or dad about the cigars yet. I know they'll find out on the night, obviously. I just wasn't sure how to tell them, so I thought I'd avoid it. Because I'm brave like that!

Dec 23, 2016, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
That sounds very ambient
Dec 23, 2016, 6:53 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, by the way, we're going to have the fire pit out on the deck. With a table and chairs. It'll be lovely 😁
Dec 23, 2016, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
Alright sure thing
Dec 23, 2016, 6:52 PM
Callum Davies
When we get back to mine
Dec 23, 2016, 6:51 PM
Callum Davies
Use one of the kitchen knives
Dec 23, 2016, 6:51 PM
Callum Davies
A knife would be better, and I'm afraid I don't, no
Dec 23, 2016, 6:51 PM
George Hughes
You got one? Or can you just use scissors?
Dec 23, 2016, 6:50 PM
George Hughes
Right, and nah they didn't
Dec 23, 2016, 6:50 PM
Callum Davies
Did the cigars come with a cigar cutter?
Dec 23, 2016, 6:49 PM
Callum Davies
Yup. You need to keep it cool; light it just enough to get it smoking, but no more. And it's meant to be taken into the lungs, alla weed and cigarettes. A bit like pipe smoking in that respect then, I suppose.
Dec 23, 2016, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Yeah probs 😂 it's more about flavour eh
Dec 23, 2016, 6:46 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry I'll have rolled it myself so it'll be just as healthy as a pipe 💁🏼😂
Dec 23, 2016, 6:46 PM
Callum Davies
Plus, smoking a cigar is totally different to smoking a pipe or a cigarette anyway. I'll probably have to teach you how to do it! 😂
Dec 23, 2016, 6:45 PM
Callum Davies
And I was talking about pipe smoking, which I now know how to do anyway. I know how to smoke a cigar, you heathen!
Dec 23, 2016, 6:29 PM
Callum Davies
Well, you can bring it. But I ain't letting that shit get anywhere near my lungs
Dec 23, 2016, 6:09 PM
George Hughes
I'm gonna bring a normal fag just so i can teach you how to smoke before we use the cigars :P
Dec 23, 2016, 2:33 PM
George Hughes
Yayyy!!! :D
Dec 23, 2016, 2:04 PM
Callum Davies
Last day, lad! Tomorrow will be the best night of your life, because you get to see meeeeee! 😁
Dec 23, 2016, 1:53 PM
George Hughes
Yeah good plan, don't get started on smoking, I know a few folk who are addicted 😕
Dec 21, 2016, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies
I know. Cigars are worse as well. I dont plan on starting smoking cigars, by the way. I just wanted a little indulgence 😉 A treat as opposed to a habit
Dec 21, 2016, 6:02 PM
George Hughes
They're also fine with alcohol which is far worse than weed or lsd etc
Dec 21, 2016, 6:01 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha don't worry you don't trip on weed 😝
Dec 21, 2016, 6:00 PM
Callum Davies
Wait, I've just realised. Not only do your parents know about your weed, but they're fine with cigars but not weed? This line is weird, man...
Dec 21, 2016, 6:00 PM
Callum Davies
Heck, bill and Ben! But that might be terrifying if you're having a bad trip! 😆
Dec 21, 2016, 5:59 PM
George Hughes
Nice! And yeah for sure, I love a good stoner comedy
Dec 21, 2016, 5:58 PM
Callum Davies
And it's gotta be a proper stoner movie, like Harold and Kumar, or Bill and Ted
Dec 21, 2016, 5:58 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, alright. Don't wanna brag, but our deck actually overlooks the Glen, so on a clear night, you get nearly exactly the same view on our deck as you do from the Glen.
Dec 21, 2016, 5:57 PM
George Hughes
I'll have a scotch on the rocks on the deck😆
Dec 21, 2016, 5:48 PM
George Hughes
Thought you might be, you're welcome to come to Edinburgh if you ever do want to have a joint and a movie sometime 😄 yeah sounds like a good plan
Dec 21, 2016, 5:47 PM
Callum Davies
That's perfectly fine. I was in two minds anyway. Do you just want a few drinks in the pub, then back to mine for cigars and scotch on the deck?
Dec 21, 2016, 5:37 PM
George Hughes
😝
Dec 21, 2016, 5:26 PM
George Hughes
Btw there will be no ganja on Saturday, parents want to know that I'm not addicted so I'm staying clean for a couple weeks
Dec 21, 2016, 5:26 PM
George Hughes
Oooh good news, does that mean I get to see?
Dec 21, 2016, 4:35 PM
Callum Davies
Looks like the machete might arrive by Christmas Eve after all
Dec 21, 2016, 1:50 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha okay dokey, night
Dec 20, 2016, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck I'm tired. I'm gonna go to bed, all this talk of blankets. Night
Dec 20, 2016, 9:49 PM
Callum Davies
You could
Dec 20, 2016, 9:49 PM
Callum Davies
You know, you always gain a blanket
Dec 20, 2016, 9:48 PM
George Hughes
Lucky, I've been wishing I had more weight because I've been freezing my ass off
Dec 20, 2016, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
*only because
Dec 20, 2016, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
I've put on a tiny bit of weight. But that's only my metabolism is all fucked up because of the amount of exercise I've been doing. Starting Christmas Eve it'll return to normal and I'll start burning it off
Dec 20, 2016, 9:47 PM
George Hughes
😋😋
Dec 20, 2016, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Bacon and eggs for breakfast, sandwich for lunch and a proper meal for dinner plus a huge pile of pancakes some nights after
Dec 20, 2016, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
A normal person would be fairly chubby on my diet
Dec 20, 2016, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Nah I feast 😝
Dec 20, 2016, 9:45 PM
Callum Davies
Plus, you're a student. You probably only have one tiny meal a day, if that. So the protein has no chance to become muscle, because it's too busy being burned away to keep you alive! 😆
Dec 20, 2016, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
Even if I want to
Dec 20, 2016, 9:43 PM
George Hughes
It's either gonna be fat or muscle but i find it impossible to put on any fat
Dec 20, 2016, 9:43 PM
George Hughes
Potentially but protein tends not to do that
Dec 20, 2016, 9:43 PM
Callum Davies
Or passing straight through you?
Dec 20, 2016, 9:42 PM
George Hughes
😆
Dec 20, 2016, 9:42 PM
George Hughes
True, my thoughts are that I've been eating a large amount of protein recently but I haven't actually gained any fat, so it must be contributing towards muscle, even if it's only a little
Dec 20, 2016, 9:42 PM
Callum Davies
You need to have been doing something for the nothing to be beneficial!
Dec 20, 2016, 9:40 PM
George Hughes
Nah muscles don't deteriorate that quickly
Dec 20, 2016, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Mostly all the nothing I've been doing
Dec 20, 2016, 9:39 PM
Callum Davies
What makes you think that? Would it be all the drugs or all the laying in bed?
Dec 20, 2016, 9:37 PM
George Hughes
I'm fairly confident I'll stand a good chance haha
Dec 20, 2016, 9:36 PM
George Hughes
Not bad, I'm really curious now
Dec 20, 2016, 9:36 PM
Callum Davies
I push heavy things too. So yeah!
Dec 20, 2016, 9:35 PM
Callum Davies
It's not exclusively lifting!
Dec 20, 2016, 9:35 PM
George Hughes
😝
Dec 20, 2016, 9:34 PM
George Hughes
But arm wrestling does use different muscles to the ones you lift with
Dec 20, 2016, 9:34 PM
George Hughes
Ahh decent, well in that case, you've got a good chance
Dec 20, 2016, 9:34 PM
Callum Davies
I'll have had a day off. Maybe if I had a shift on Christmas Eve, then yes. But if I can do an 11 hour shift after only 8 hours of sleep to rest, I think I'll be fine after 8 hours of sleep and about 12 hours of nothing
Dec 20, 2016, 9:33 PM
George Hughes
One problem is you might be exhausted by the time we finally wrestle
Dec 20, 2016, 9:31 PM
Callum Davies
10 consecutive 11 hour shifts makes for pretty good training, wouldn't you say?
Dec 20, 2016, 9:30 PM
George Hughes
Really? I wonder if you will 😆
Dec 20, 2016, 9:29 PM
Callum Davies
Gonna thrash you at that arm wrestle! I have been training😠
Dec 20, 2016, 9:27 PM
George Hughes
Getting there 😮
Dec 20, 2016, 9:23 PM
Callum Davies
7 down, 3 to go
Dec 20, 2016, 9:20 PM
George Hughes
Fair play 😆
Dec 20, 2016, 9:20 PM
Callum Davies
Nor did I, I was just curious
Dec 20, 2016, 9:20 PM
George Hughes
I've not needed to take mine apart haha
Dec 20, 2016, 9:19 PM
Callum Davies
No matter, I've found out. Just give the two ends separated by the silver ring a fair ol' tug, and you'll see, trust me. It won't break it. I did it, and mine is perfectly fine
Dec 20, 2016, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
Have you worked out how to detach your pipe yet? Because I can't seem to suss it
Dec 20, 2016, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Wow well done you guys 😝
Dec 20, 2016, 4:18 PM
Callum Davies
If it's any consolation, we set a new factory record for amount of output within a single day on Saturday. So it's a good thing I cancelled?
Dec 20, 2016, 3:37 PM
George Hughes
Sure thing
Dec 19, 2016, 11:21 PM
Callum Davies
Please don't let Kyle know about our presents. It's too late for me to buy anything for him now, and as you know, I don't have a chance anyway because I'm working up until Christmas Eve
Dec 19, 2016, 1:52 PM
Callum Davies
Tis a plan then, huzzah! 🙌🏻🎩
Dec 18, 2016, 8:16 PM
George Hughes
Sounds good to me 😄
Dec 18, 2016, 8:09 PM
Callum Davies
I've double checked with the pub, we will be able to do a tab. But it's for transactions over £10 (which I'm sure we'll be spending much more than 😉) and there's a 50p charge on every transaction, because they're a small business. But we were originally talking about spending £30 each on the night, so what's 25p each at the end of the night. So there's no need to bring any actual money on the night, just bring your card. We'll put both our cards behind the bar at the start of the night and set up a tab, then just split the bill between the two cards at the end of the night. And no arguments about who's getting the first round, because we're both paying at the end of the night! 😀 But I'll still have that arm wrestle with you, though. 😉
Dec 18, 2016, 7:25 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, you've got a debit card, right? Do you just want to put both our cards behind the bar to create a joint tab, and then just split the cost between our two cards at the end of the night?
Dec 18, 2016, 6:57 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. But it's a five minute commute on foot. Other jobs would have travel expenses. I've not got any proper qualifications. And minimum wage for my age is £5.30/hour, which is probably what I would be paid at any other job I could get, due to the aforementioned qualifications conundrum. I'm currently earning £6.95/hour.
Dec 18, 2016, 1:52 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I kinda get you, there's not much you can really do except grin and bear it or find a less taxing job
Dec 18, 2016, 1:49 PM
Callum Davies
Oftentimes I feel like both. Most of the guys here are a good 5 or 10 years my senior, and I'm always thinking in getting overworked and underpaid, much like a slave. Although I guess slaves were overworked to death, and didn't actually get paid at all, so I guess not exactly like a slave. But you get my point
Dec 18, 2016, 1:48 PM
George Hughes
Thank goodness you're neither a child nor a slave
Dec 18, 2016, 1:46 PM
Callum Davies
Ah, I shouldn't be complaining. A bit of hard work never killed anyone. Except the thousands of slaves who built the pyramids. And those children in the factories at the dawn of the Victorian industrial revolution...😐
Dec 18, 2016, 1:38 PM

So am I, to be honest! 😜
Dec 16, 2016, 8:33 PM

I'm genuinely curious to see how strong you are after all that potato lifting 😝
Dec 16, 2016, 8:27 PM

This'll be interesting
Dec 16, 2016, 8:27 PM
Callum Davies
It's on! 😠
Dec 16, 2016, 8:26 PM
George Hughes
I'm up for an arm wrestle 😉
Dec 16, 2016, 8:26 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, by the way, to decide who pays for first round on Christmas Eve, coin flip or arm wrestle?
Dec 16, 2016, 8:26 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha well predicted 😆
Dec 16, 2016, 8:25 PM
Callum Davies
My mummy always said potatoes would make me strong😊
Dec 16, 2016, 8:24 PM

Dec 16, 2016, 8:22 PM

I won't. 😁 You been hitting the gym recently?
Dec 16, 2016, 8:21 PM

Don't hurt meh
Dec 16, 2016, 8:20 PM

Dec 16, 2016, 8:20 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, shut up. Remember I have a knife now...
Dec 16, 2016, 8:20 PM

I can imagine 😝 I don't really even need a job this year
Dec 16, 2016, 8:19 PM
Callum Davies
😉
Dec 16, 2016, 8:18 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, sure. You making £100 in three hours. You know, the stuff that makes me want to strangle you
Dec 16, 2016, 8:18 PM
George Hughes
True 😆 I've got my busking anyways when I need extra cash 💁🏼
Dec 16, 2016, 8:17 PM
Callum Davies
*I'm not
Dec 16, 2016, 8:16 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, I'm going to have to pay my wages back to a bank in 4 years
Dec 16, 2016, 8:16 PM
George Hughes
Nope the tuition fees don't even go by me, it's the saas, I guess technically it's a loan but it's a pretty decent deal
Dec 16, 2016, 8:16 PM
Callum Davies
You're not being paid that. You're being given it so you can PAY the university to study nothing
Dec 16, 2016, 8:15 PM
George Hughes
I wonder that myself sometimes 💁🏼 I'm being paid about 7 grand (I think) to study nothing 🎉
Dec 16, 2016, 8:14 PM
Callum Davies
What studies!? 😂
Dec 16, 2016, 8:12 PM
George Hughes
Indeed you are, God of light 😝 nah I mean cause my studies 😆
Dec 16, 2016, 8:12 PM
Callum Davies
How come I can do it then. I must be a god 😏
Dec 16, 2016, 8:11 PM
George Hughes
Which would be impossible 😂
Dec 16, 2016, 8:11 PM
Callum Davies
You'd also have to work 5 11-hour and 2 10-hour shifts
Dec 16, 2016, 8:11 PM
George Hughes
For a week, I'd be okay with that
Dec 16, 2016, 8:10 PM
Callum Davies
You know, plus £500. There's that as well
Dec 16, 2016, 8:08 PM

That's cool, I'll be sure to let you know 😄
Dec 15, 2016, 2:25 PM
Callum Davies
I'm afraid we can't pick you up because I can't drive yet because of that bloody bus! 😤 Mum will be busy preparing the house for her childminding on Monday, and Dad will be away down to Sunderland by then. But you'll definitely be able to get the bus back. Weekdays and Saturday the buses are okay, it's just on Sunday that they're virtually non existent. Maybe I should book my next test for a Sunday... Anyway, if you could just drop me a message, or even a text if you really love me, to say when abouts you plan on arriving on Sunday. Cheers 😉
Dec 15, 2016, 1:37 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I doubt I'll be back and unpacked before 6😂 I'm sure they won't mind
Dec 15, 2016, 11:10 AM
Callum Davies
Actually, the latest I can find to Abernethy on a Sunday is the number 36, which is at the main Street at 17:50 at the latest. May have to consider begging parents! 😜
Dec 15, 2016, 11:09 AM
Callum Davies
How about taking the 19:50 (or whatever time it arrives at your house) that drops you in Abernethy for 20:03? Sounds like a good time for you to arrive 😊 Just an idea
Dec 15, 2016, 8:30 AM
Callum Davies
I'll have one very occasionally, but on the whole, I stay away from drink
Dec 15, 2016, 8:24 AM

Semi t total? What's that?
Dec 14, 2016, 10:40 PM

Dec 14, 2016, 6:55 PM

Will do 😄
Dec 14, 2016, 6:46 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then. Let me know when abouts you'll be getting here on Sunday
Dec 14, 2016, 6:34 PM
George Hughes
I'll bring £31.60 because I think that's how much a bus is but I can't remember
Dec 14, 2016, 6:28 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I'm planning on taking £30, and drinks are about £3 each, so that's about £6 a round. So I'm bringing enough for 5 rounds.
Dec 14, 2016, 6:26 PM
George Hughes
my tolerance has increased so I may well be costing myself a bit more 😆
Dec 14, 2016, 6:23 PM

Dec 14, 2016, 6:22 PM

Hey, just for Sunday, could you make sure that you have the song 'Vincent' by Don MacLean downloaded onto your tablet or phone or whatever? It's a really good song, nice to listen to I think. And also some psychedelic Dark Side 😉

Dec 13, 2016, 8:32 AM
Callum Davies
No pressure then 😂
Dec 13, 2016, 7:55 AM
George Hughes
Okay dokey, good luck! I'm counting on you 😝 night!
Dec 12, 2016, 10:15 PM
Callum Davies
I'm off to bed now. Got to rest up for my driving test tomorrow. See you later
Dec 12, 2016, 10:04 PM
Callum Davies
Apparently when smoking pipe tobacco it's more for the taste as well.
Dec 12, 2016, 10:03 PM
Callum Davies
I know! Cigars are basically designer smoke, I think. Still want a try, though 😆
Dec 12, 2016, 9:57 PM
George Hughes
weed you've got to take all the way into your lungs xD
Dec 12, 2016, 9:56 PM
George Hughes
i mean i wouldn't mind a baccy buzz, if we've had a drink, it tends to go down well
Dec 12, 2016, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, just for when we smoke those cigars, apparently you're not meant to inhale the smoke into your lungs. You just kinda swirl it around your mouth and through your nose for the taste, more than the effect, like I imagine is the case with weed.
Dec 12, 2016, 9:55 PM
George Hughes
I mean i hadn't smoked anything up until a couple months ago xD even then, i mostly smoke pot, i'm not too into tobacco haha
Dec 12, 2016, 9:54 PM
Callum Davies
Nope, I'm afraid not😞
Dec 12, 2016, 9:53 PM
George Hughes
I can teach you 😆
Dec 12, 2016, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
Haha so you've never smoked anything then?
Dec 12, 2016, 9:52 PM
Callum Davies
Nope, but always fancied it. Same as cigars. I guess you'll have to teach me! 😂
Dec 12, 2016, 9:51 PM
George Hughes
You ever smoked out a pipe before?
Haha yass 😆😄
Dec 12, 2016, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
So we'll match. Yay!
Dec 12, 2016, 9:49 PM
Callum Davies
Nice. I love pipes. So much more refined than cigarettes
Dec 12, 2016, 9:49 PM
George Hughes
Yeah it does
Dec 12, 2016, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
Yup, that's the one I got too. Does yours have the floral design as well?
Dec 12, 2016, 9:47 PM
George Hughes
Here ya go
Dec 12, 2016, 9:46 PM
George Hughes

Dec 12, 2016, 9:46 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, are you able to get that Amazon listing yet?
Dec 12, 2016, 9:43 PM
George Hughes
Holy shit that's true
Dec 12, 2016, 9:42 PM
Callum Davies
You know it to be true, George. I am curved and rich in potassium!
Dec 12, 2016, 9:37 PM
George Hughes
Oh shit you can't be a banana? It's not true!
Dec 12, 2016, 9:36 PM
Callum Davies
A conspiracy
Dec 12, 2016, 9:35 PM
Callum Davies
There's one for you
Dec 12, 2016, 9:35 PM
George Hughes
What?
Dec 12, 2016, 9:35 PM
Callum Davies

Dec 12, 2016, 9:35 PM

Lizard rulers; cats. They're all the same
Dec 12, 2016, 9:34 PM

I was gonna say I think that's cats you're thinking of 😆

Dec 12, 2016, 9:33 PM
Callum Davies
Now, rub our bellies!
Dec 12, 2016, 9:33 PM
George Hughes
Oh wait, I'm one to talk
Dec 12, 2016, 9:33 PM
George Hughes
Stop being so stereotypical about Scottish people you English scum 😝
Dec 12, 2016, 9:33 PM

Give us blood, for it is tasty
Dec 12, 2016, 9:32 PM

We are gods😎
Dec 12, 2016, 9:31 PM

Wait so we're aliens?
Dec 12, 2016, 9:30 PM
Callum Davies
In terms of weather, that is
Dec 12, 2016, 9:30 PM
Callum Davies
Scotland is the adopted redheaded retard of children of the world
Dec 12, 2016, 9:30 PM
Callum Davies
Precisely
Dec 12, 2016, 9:29 PM
George Hughes
We've had some really warm evenings here recently 😂
Dec 12, 2016, 9:29 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but this is Scotland. "Rain and snow? But this is Christmas! That sort of weather is for mid June, isn't it?" Oh, Scotland! 😊
Dec 12, 2016, 9:28 PM
George Hughes
Just hope it's not too damp
Dec 12, 2016, 9:26 PM
Callum Davies
🔥
Dec 12, 2016, 9:26 PM
George Hughes
That sounds really fun 😅
Dec 12, 2016, 9:26 PM
Callum Davies
And then...
Dec 12, 2016, 9:26 PM
Callum Davies
And I'll have my knife. We can make wood shavings to use as kindling to get it started, then build a protective structure out of any dry wood we find.
Dec 12, 2016, 9:26 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I always carry a lighter 💁🏼
Dec 12, 2016, 9:24 PM
Callum Davies
Sounds good. I'm assuming you'll have a lighter? I'm just thinking about starting the campfire. Because we will need a source of light and heat. It'll be dark and cold 😱 Plus making fire is manly! 💪🏻👍🏻
Dec 12, 2016, 9:22 PM
George Hughes
Good shout, also if it's as pretty as you say it is, drink counteracts lsd so I'll not load up prior to that
Dec 12, 2016, 9:20 PM
Callum Davies
Okay. Oh, by the way, just remember that we'll have the Talisker as well in the woods. So don't load up too much at the pub, because there's more to come 😉
Dec 12, 2016, 9:18 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I'll search for places in Edinburgh once in back in my room
Dec 12, 2016, 9:16 PM
Callum Davies
Btw, I just googled 'cigar', and the first result was the first three places that sold cigars, two of which were in Edinburgh. So I imagine a little research will yield great results! 😀
Dec 12, 2016, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
What's the craic?
Dec 12, 2016, 9:12 PM
Callum Davies
Hi
Dec 12, 2016, 9:12 PM
George Hughes
I'm finally back
Dec 12, 2016, 9:12 PM
George Hughes
Hey again
Dec 12, 2016, 9:12 PM
Callum Davies
Alright
Dec 12, 2016, 8:50 PM
George Hughes
Message you in 15
Dec 12, 2016, 8:50 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then, cheers 😉
Dec 12, 2016, 8:48 PM
George Hughes
Went to Tesco, 2 mile walk each way, while
High and now these bags are killing my hands
Dec 12, 2016, 8:47 PM
George Hughes
Haha she knows Edinburgh pretty well and I think she occasionally smokes 🙄 yeah sure once I'm back home
Dec 12, 2016, 8:47 PM
Callum Davies
Your mum!? Wasn't expecting that answer. What a cool mum. Also, you couldn't lift the Amazon listing for the pipe from your order history and send me a link, could you?
Dec 12, 2016, 8:44 PM
George Hughes
I wouldn't let you, not got much left and it's hard to come by 😏😝 not yet but I've asked mum on messenger so she might know somewhere
Dec 12, 2016, 8:43 PM
Callum Davies
I'll take the second, if you wouldn't mind 😂 You're quite welcome to have the former yourself, but I'm afraid I shall not be partaking. Also, any leads yet on those cigars?
Dec 12, 2016, 8:41 PM
George Hughes
I can assure you the second one is clean 😄
Dec 12, 2016, 8:39 PM
George Hughes
I've got two types on stuff, sativa with lsd and a mix of indica and sativa (both are weed)
Dec 12, 2016, 8:39 PM
Callum Davies
I'm trusting you. I won't have anything at all if you can't assure me that the stuff you give me isn't laced with anything else
Dec 12, 2016, 8:37 PM
George Hughes
😉
Dec 12, 2016, 8:36 PM
George Hughes
I mean it's all in your brain before you take the drug, the drug just brings it to the front
Dec 12, 2016, 8:36 PM
Callum Davies
Nope. I'm only having the natural stuff. Nothing synthesised for me I'm afraid
Dec 12, 2016, 8:35 PM
George Hughes
I look forward to it, I might even have a little lsd weed to enjoy it even more 😝
Dec 12, 2016, 8:34 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, and by the way. I know I was just saying I wanted to show you the Glen because mum was in the room, but it is also true. The glen is beautiful, especially at night with a clear sky
Dec 12, 2016, 8:17 PM
George Hughes
Lovely
Dec 12, 2016, 8:10 PM
Callum Davies
And the hunting knife

Dec 12, 2016, 7:50 PM
Callum Davies
There's the machete

Dec 12, 2016, 7:50 PM
George Hughes
But everything was much prettier last night on the trip 😝
Dec 12, 2016, 7:49 PM
George Hughes
Nice 😄 just walked along the canal, it's so beautiful atm
Dec 12, 2016, 7:49 PM
Callum Davies
And I'm a bit of a woodsman, like Kyle. I'll use them on my trips to the Glen. Been wanting a proper hunting knife for ages
Dec 12, 2016, 7:48 PM
Callum Davies
Not dealing. Your not getting them. They're mine 😏
Dec 12, 2016, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
That's pretty neat tho
Dec 12, 2016, 7:29 PM
George Hughes
Oh wow 😮 dealing arms now? 😝
Dec 12, 2016, 7:29 PM
Callum Davies
That's me put in an order for a good solid hunting knife on Amazon, so we'll be able to have a fire in the glen. I've also ordered a foot long machete from the same supplier, but that's temporarily out of stock. They'll send us one when they have them again. So well definitely have a good knife, and possibly a machete as well, if it arrives on time 😁
Dec 12, 2016, 7:20 PM
Callum Davies
The Karoom called you.
Duration: 8 minutes
Dec 12, 2016, 6:22 PM
George Hughes
Sound, see you then
Dec 12, 2016, 5:28 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, I'll give you a call after I come off work. That'll be anywhere between 6 and quarter past
Dec 12, 2016, 3:37 PM
George Hughes
Aw awesome, that might be helpful! And sure thing
Dec 12, 2016, 3:22 PM
Callum Davies
Am I alright to call you a little after 6:00 this evening to nail down the details?
Dec 12, 2016, 1:37 PM
Callum Davies
Also, I've just realised that there's a VERY high chance that I'll be driving by Christmas (because I'm going to fucking PASS my test tomorrow this time!) So I could pick you up and drop you off. I'll just make sure I don't drink anything until we're back in Nethy, and by the morning I'll be sober
Dec 12, 2016, 1:36 PM
Callum Davies
Hold the pipe by the bowl, it looks better
Dec 12, 2016, 11:05 AM
George Hughes
No worries
Dec 12, 2016, 12:03 AM
Callum Davies
Nah, going to bed soon
Dec 12, 2016, 12:03 AM
George Hughes
Awesome 😆 feel like a call?
Dec 12, 2016, 12:01 AM
Callum Davies
'Tis done
Dec 12, 2016, 12:00 AM
George Hughes
Enjoy your purchase 😝
Dec 12, 2016, 12:00 AM
George Hughes

Dec 11, 2016, 11:59 PM
George Hughes
We smoke from it all the time and we all agree it's a really nice pipe 😝 it's very cheap but it doesn't seem cheap
Dec 11, 2016, 11:08 PM
Callum Davies
You can guarantee the quality of this pipe?
Dec 11, 2016, 11:06 PM
Callum Davies
I've found that pipe
Dec 11, 2016, 11:03 PM
George Hughes
Haha the idea of living with parents feels really weird now 😆
Dec 11, 2016, 10:08 PM
Callum Davies
Tomorrow
Dec 11, 2016, 10:08 PM
Callum Davies
I'll ask Mum
Dec 11, 2016, 10:07 PM
George Hughes
I'll get my parents to drive me there, would
I be able to sleepover? And I'll get my parents to pick me up, or if the buses are running, I'll catch one
Dec 11, 2016, 10:06 PM
Callum Davies
So how are you getting here? And back?
Dec 11, 2016, 10:05 PM
George Hughes
That sounds great! I'm up for that
Dec 11, 2016, 10:05 PM
Callum Davies
Do you want to come to Abernethy for Christmas evening? We have a pub, and even if it's closed, we'll just go straight into the woods. It's just that I doubt the buses will be running, and I won't be able to drive if we're drinking and smoking
Dec 11, 2016, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
That'll be fun!
Dec 11, 2016, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers. I say two because one for you and one for me, obviously! 😆 As I say, don't go mad on price.
Dec 11, 2016, 9:54 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I can sort that out! 😄
Dec 11, 2016, 9:52 PM
Callum Davies
Do you think you could get your hands on a couple of decent-ish cigars (don't go crazy, not too expensive). It's kinda the one thing I've always wanted to try, is a proper cigar 😆
Dec 11, 2016, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
Not yet, was there anything in particular you were wanting? 😉
Dec 11, 2016, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, could I just ask, have you bought my Christmas present yet?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:49 PM
George Hughes
Haha nice man! I guess you'll have the occasional pipe of tobacco? Didn't really have you down as much of a smoker 😝
Dec 11, 2016, 9:46 PM
Callum Davies
Buying a pipe now! 😆
Dec 11, 2016, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Whatcha up to?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:42 PM
Callum Davies
Okay
Dec 11, 2016, 9:42 PM
George Hughes
Search tobacco pipe on Amazon?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:41 PM
George Hughes
No idea, just found it going cheap on Amazon💁🏼
Dec 11, 2016, 9:41 PM
Callum Davies
What's the brand?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:41 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, I see.
Dec 11, 2016, 9:40 PM
George Hughes
Think it's just wood
Dec 11, 2016, 9:40 PM
Callum Davies
What's that one made of?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Much nicer than a cheap metal pipe
Dec 11, 2016, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Haha sure I'll let you know, it is a lovely pipe to smoke from 😅
Dec 11, 2016, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
Well, if you ever find that you no longer need it, I'll take it off your hands 😆
Dec 11, 2016, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
I'm getting better at rolling tho
Dec 11, 2016, 9:34 PM
George Hughes
Hah that's interesting 😄
Dec 11, 2016, 9:34 PM
Callum Davies
I know. Up until relatively recently (bout 1980's-ish, I think) life insurance policies didn't put you down as a smoker if you smoked a pipe😆
Dec 11, 2016, 9:32 PM
George Hughes
😝
Dec 11, 2016, 9:30 PM
George Hughes
It's healthier to smoke out of a pipe
Dec 11, 2016, 9:30 PM
George Hughes
Stick a filter mesh in it and put the pot on that
Dec 11, 2016, 9:30 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. I wouldn't have thought you could get it to burn to a high enough temperature using a pipe, but what do I know?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:29 PM
George Hughes
To smoke my dank
Dec 11, 2016, 9:28 PM

Dec 11, 2016, 9:28 PM

Dec 11, 2016, 9:27 PM
George Hughes
Sure?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:27 PM
Callum Davies
Not bad. I have been wondering something though. I don't know why it's been bugging me, but could you clear something up for me?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:27 PM
George Hughes
How's life going?
Dec 11, 2016, 9:25 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then.
Dec 11, 2016, 9:25 PM

Anyway, I've got work in the morning, so I'll see you soon
Nov 27, 2016, 9:23 PM
George Hughes
Haha some consideration, that's what I like to hear 😉
Nov 27, 2016, 9:22 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, we'll see. 😉
Nov 27, 2016, 9:22 PM
George Hughes
Tis cool 😝 see how you feel at the time but it's fine if you'd rather not
Nov 27, 2016, 9:22 PM
Callum Davies
I'd rather not 😕
Nov 27, 2016, 9:21 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha you should smell my wallet and jacket 😂💁🏼
Nov 27, 2016, 9:21 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, I'd be more worried about my lungs than my brain tbh. Buy one won't hurt. I just don't want my clothes smelling of smoke after! I don't need those dry cleaning bills! 😂
Nov 27, 2016, 9:21 PM

I believe you 😝

There's a whole political party dedicated to it. CISTA (Cannabis Is Safer Than Alcohol)
Nov 27, 2016, 9:19 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I know
Nov 27, 2016, 9:18 PM
George Hughes
Just throwing that out there
Nov 27, 2016, 9:17 PM
George Hughes
Alcohol is far worse for you than weed is 😉
Nov 27, 2016, 9:17 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that sounds good, one pipe won't touch your memory tho 😝 if you're still against it tho, then sure, some banter is perfect for me, especially if I'm high 😆
Nov 27, 2016, 9:16 PM
Callum Davies
But we're still good to go in the woods. You can light up and we'll have a good chat. Ahh, we'll see what happens on the night, you know. Just take some rolls and a six pack into the woods and shoot the shit for a little bit
Nov 27, 2016, 9:05 PM
Callum Davies
Nope. Not yet anyway. I've seen the studies. It has been proven to cause memory loss to those whose brains are still developing. After about 25, go nuts. No harm whatsoever. It's been proven. But yeah, I'm gonna wait. I pride myself on my memory! 😁
Nov 27, 2016, 9:04 PM
George Hughes
Defo not
Nov 27, 2016, 9:03 PM
George Hughes
Nah we'll not get drunk tho
Nov 27, 2016, 9:03 PM
George Hughes
Are you not fancying the weed anymore?
Nov 27, 2016, 9:02 PM
Callum Davies
Also, you do realise I'll probably be either greatly reduced or t total by the time Christmas comes around. I may have a drink or two, but I'm not going mad. And I don't smoke, you know that
Nov 27, 2016, 9:00 PM
George Hughes
Yeah defo, but we'll get the bus to Abernethy before we smoke?
Nov 27, 2016, 9:00 PM
Callum Davies
I want to have a nice time. It's Christmas for god's sake! Also, I was thinking we should probably invite Kyle
Nov 27, 2016, 8:59 PM
George Hughes
But it'll be unnoticeable
Nov 27, 2016, 8:58 PM
Callum Davies
You can, and will
Nov 27, 2016, 8:58 PM
George Hughes
Can't guarantee I won't be slightly high tho
Nov 27, 2016, 8:58 PM
George Hughes
Don't worry, I'm saving that for afterwards 😝
Nov 27, 2016, 8:58 PM
Callum Davies
You had better not fucking show up drunk and high when we go out at Christmas. I'm just saying that now
Nov 27, 2016, 8:57 PM
George Hughes
Haha does that mean going to watch YouTube videos in bed?
Nov 24, 2016, 1:32 AM
Callum Davies
Ish
Nov 24, 2016, 1:31 AM
George Hughes
You going to bed now?
Nov 24, 2016, 1:31 AM

You may have a point there. But, I do also know that there's nobody whom he is more comfortable around than Beth. So while he may not tell you or I, he would certainly tell Beth
Nov 13, 2016, 11:06 AM
George Hughes
I'm probably being paranoid but I just feel a bit protective haha
Nov 13, 2016, 8:35 AM
George Hughes
My worry is that Kyle wouldn't tell anyone if he's not okay with it
Nov 13, 2016, 8:34 AM
Callum Davies
So long as Kyle's okay with it, I see no problem
Nov 13, 2016, 8:31 AM
George Hughes
Hey Callum, what's your thoughts on Beth's polyamorous relationship?
Nov 13, 2016, 2:59 AM

Nov 10, 2016, 6:38 PM

Okay
Nov 9, 2016, 12:25 AM
George Hughes
Feel like video calling?
Nov 9, 2016, 12:24 AM
George Hughes
Well I'm still up :P
Nov 8, 2016, 5:57 AM
George Hughes
Yeah I'm skiving if it is 😝😂
Nov 7, 2016, 9:47 PM
Callum Davies
Well, I'm not sure about that. But it'll certainly be fun😉
Nov 7, 2016, 9:39 PM
George Hughes
Yeah we'll see, let me know 😝 and Christmas will be class 👌🏼
Nov 7, 2016, 9:38 PM
Callum Davies
But this place looks like a new place. It looks different to the place we've used for the previous years. Rog did say that we'd have actual beds this year, but I didn't think he meant we were using a whole different place! This place looks like the real deal, I'm genuinely not sure how lax they will be on people leaving for personal reasons. I know that I certainly won't be able to go back clearly drunk or high. I'll have to keep it to just a couple of drinks, I'm afraid. And I certainly won't be able to be smoking. But we can have a bit of fun at Christmas, eh? 😉 Also, I might bring Duncan, for a ride and a laugh. I'm sure I can sit on the back of his bike. Motorbike. He's a great laugh. I think you'd love him. But as I say. I'm not even sure if they'll let us out
Nov 7, 2016, 9:35 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, but that's a fraction of what you'll spend in the entire night
Nov 7, 2016, 9:28 PM
George Hughes
Because I go clubbing and drinking 😝😂
Nov 7, 2016, 9:26 PM
Callum Davies
You can go clubbing and drinking but you can't afford a tenner for a taxi?
Nov 7, 2016, 9:23 PM
George Hughes
Hmm I'm not keen but if it's the only way then sure
Nov 7, 2016, 9:22 PM
Callum Davies
Want to split a cab? Google reckon it'll only be about £20
Nov 7, 2016, 9:21 PM
George Hughes
Could be the 25??
Nov 7, 2016, 9:21 PM
George Hughes
Ask google maps 😂
Nov 7, 2016, 9:21 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck me if I know. You're the swanky metropolitan elite living it up in the city! Which bus should I be getting?
Nov 7, 2016, 9:20 PM
George Hughes
Do*
Nov 7, 2016, 9:18 PM
George Hughes
What bus number so you get?
Nov 7, 2016, 9:18 PM
George Hughes
You're out the same way as me
Nov 7, 2016, 9:18 PM
Callum Davies

Nov 7, 2016, 9:13 PM
Callum Davies
I will probably just settle down to a box set before bed now. Oh god, listen to me, I'm old! Anyway see you soon
Nov 7, 2016, 9:04 PM
George Hughes
I'm gonna go cook something to eat, I'll be back in half an hour or so if you're still about
Nov 7, 2016, 9:03 PM

Can I call you?
Nov 7, 2016, 7:59 PM
George Hughes
Alright, should be easy enough to get to you I think
Nov 7, 2016, 7:58 PM
Callum Davies
I know where we're staying is not far from St Andrews square
Nov 7, 2016, 7:57 PM
George Hughes
I'll ask
Nov 7, 2016, 7:56 PM
George Hughes
I dunno where it is yet lol
Nov 7, 2016, 7:56 PM
Callum Davies
Could you have me the address of the place?
Nov 7, 2016, 7:55 PM
George Hughes
I guess so 🙄 I mean you could always come to the jazz bar and drink a little but not go crazy then head back when we go to the clubs
Nov 7, 2016, 7:54 PM
George Hughes
Aww man, no worries 💁🏼 yeah spoken with Sophie and she's gonna hook me up with the dealers in Perth
Nov 7, 2016, 7:53 PM
Callum Davies
I'll be going as a young leader, you see. I'll need to be responsible. Looking after minors, and all that
Nov 7, 2016, 7:53 PM
Callum Davies
I probably won't be able to sneak out, really. But we can certainly meet up for Christmas still. You can bring your doobies then!!
Nov 7, 2016, 7:52 PM
George Hughes
Mebbe smoke a joint or two at the end
Nov 7, 2016, 7:50 PM
George Hughes
Brilliant, 9ish probs, not sure where yet, we'd meet you in town, go to a jazz bar for a bit, then go to the clubs if you're up for any of that 😝
Nov 7, 2016, 7:49 PM
Callum Davies
Because I'll be on Edinburgh camp with my Explorers unit. But I might be allowed to sneak out for a few hours
Nov 7, 2016, 7:48 PM
George Hughes
About 30/40 mins on the bus away from the centre
Nov 7, 2016, 7:48 PM
George Hughes
Near Currie
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
Callum Davies
Ah, I see. Where exactly in Ed are you?
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
Apart from Ali's piano playing
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
Plus there's fuck all jazz music in Perth
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
George Hughes
I'm sill gonna be in ed until just before Christmas probs 😂my last exam is on the 8th anyways
Nov 7, 2016, 7:47 PM
Callum Davies
Funnily enough, I'll actually be in Edinburgh on your birthday. We'll have switched places! 😂
Nov 7, 2016, 7:46 PM
George Hughes
Thought jazz music might get your attention
Nov 7, 2016, 7:43 PM
George Hughes
I have plans related to jazz music
Nov 7, 2016, 7:41 PM

Sounds like a plan😝
Oct 25, 2016, 12:08 PM
Callum Davies
This evening, then? I've got to chat with you about something anyway 😉
Oct 25, 2016, 12:07 PM
George Hughes
That'll be fine, either suits me
Oct 24, 2016, 7:52 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not sure. If it had to be any time, I would have to be Tuesday or Wednesday evening
Oct 24, 2016, 7:26 PM
George Hughes
Fancy a Skype at some point?
Oct 24, 2016, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
That's a good question 😂😂
Oct 24, 2016, 3:06 PM
Callum Davies
Will the pub even be open on Christmas day?
Oct 24, 2016, 1:47 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, and I'll give you your Christmas/birthday present😉
Oct 24, 2016, 1:41 PM
George Hughes
In the evening? Go for a cheeky few pints in the pub, introduce me to some interesting drinks 😝
Oct 23, 2016, 9:07 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, if you still want to meet up Christmas day, I might be able to. Might only have to be for a few hours though; what with it being Christmas, and all.
Oct 23, 2016, 8:51 PM
George Hughes
Meh, it'll be more exciting next year once your at uni ;)
Oct 18, 2016, 5:41 PM
Callum Davies
Not really. Just work and TV really.
Oct 18, 2016, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
Anything interesting happening/happened of late? :P
Oct 18, 2016, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
It is good. 😂
Oct 18, 2016, 5:29 PM
George Hughes
Sounds good
Oct 18, 2016, 5:28 PM
Callum Davies
Just at my Grandma and Grandad's house
Oct 18, 2016, 5:28 PM
George Hughes
Ahh, lovely, wuu2 now?
Oct 18, 2016, 5:27 PM
Callum Davies
I've finished it. 6-4
Oct 18, 2016, 5:26 PM

Wooo I do love me some of that (y) you on break rn or day off?
Oct 18, 2016, 5:26 PM

10 hour shift. Yay!
Oct 18, 2016, 5:25 PM
George Hughes
Good to hear xD
Oct 18, 2016, 5:25 PM
Callum Davies
Yup
Oct 18, 2016, 5:25 PM
George Hughes
I assume you managed to get up for work then :P
Oct 18, 2016, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
Too much on your mind?
Oct 17, 2016, 2:49 AM
Callum Davies
I just can't sleep
Oct 17, 2016, 2:49 AM
George Hughes
Insomnia?
Oct 17, 2016, 2:49 AM
Callum Davies
I can't!
Oct 17, 2016, 2:48 AM
George Hughes
Go to sleep :P
Oct 17, 2016, 2:43 AM
George Hughes
My solution for that is stay up all fucking night and just have a shite day 😝 it's been awesome to chat again😄 have a successful sleep, and have fun getting up
Oct 17, 2016, 12:42 AM
Callum Davies
Anyway, it's been great catching up, but I think I should probably at least try to get some sleep before I have to be up for *oh God* 6 😖
Oct 17, 2016, 12:40 AM
George Hughes
Also get this: I haven't had Irn bru in 2 weeks, we haven't bought any fizzy drinks for two weeks so I've been living off squash 😝 it's something you can learn, however don't ask your mum to teach you 😱😱😱 (epic rap battle crowd)
Just kidding 😂 cheese poisoning sounds very serious 😝
Oct 17, 2016, 12:39 AM
Callum Davies
I shall be the first recorded case
Oct 17, 2016, 12:37 AM
Callum Davies
And I don't know how I'm going to survive at uni. I can't cook for shit; I'm pretty sure I'm going to die of cheese poisoning
Oct 17, 2016, 12:37 AM
George Hughes
The thought of it makes me sad 😖
Oct 17, 2016, 12:36 AM
Callum Davies
Well, except for a bit of paper with a big number on it 😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:35 AM
George Hughes
Time for a pizza.. Don't worry I've usually been eating really well, we just have very little food left to cook with atm.
Oh and your wallet is miraculously empty
Oct 17, 2016, 12:35 AM
Callum Davies
That'll happen. You go in the pub at 8, and in what feels like half an hour, it's midnight already! 😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:34 AM
George Hughes
Drunk is more fun.. But time goes quicker 😢
Oct 17, 2016, 12:33 AM
Callum Davies
But slightly tipsy
Oct 17, 2016, 12:32 AM
Callum Davies
I know, I wasn't drunk.
Oct 17, 2016, 12:32 AM
George Hughes
You didn't even have that much 😂😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:32 AM
Callum Davies
You're right, drunk people are the worst 

Oct 17, 2016, 12:31 AM
George Hughes
Yep I know, alcohol is such a wonderful thing, entertainment on both fronts 😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:31 AM
Callum Davies
You know you were exactly like that at my party, right? 😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:29 AM
George Hughes
Drunk people are Sooo funny
Oct 17, 2016, 12:28 AM
George Hughes
Keir came into the kitchen where Rosie, Alasatair and myself are sitting fully sober doing work, and messaging etc, and Keir's friend from home Connor comes in with him, and poor Connor has had far too much, "hey guys, tell me about how much I should have to drink, what should I have", all very very slurred, and we're just sitting awkwardly while he starts stroking everyone's shoulders 🙄😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:28 AM
Callum Davies
Do tell...
Oct 17, 2016, 12:26 AM
George Hughes
I'll take a look once I'm back in my room.. The best thing just happened
Oct 17, 2016, 12:26 AM
Callum Davies
Just take a look at it if you get a moment, if you want to. Give you something to talk about with your learned university friends 😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:24 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, by the, when I was talking about Peter Finch, this is what I was talking about:

Don't worry, you won't see much of Stoner George
Oct 17, 2016, 12:22 AM
George Hughes
But doood, the air is so cool outside
Oct 17, 2016, 12:21 AM
Callum Davies
Good, good. Weed is healthier as well. Just don't get doing any stronger stuff. And keep it recreational, don't be going pothead on us now. 😉 We don't want to lose our George
Oct 17, 2016, 12:21 AM
George Hughes
Tried smoking cigarettes but weed is so much better
Oct 17, 2016, 12:19 AM
George Hughes
Just plain old pot yep 👌🏼😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:19 AM
Callum Davies
Woah, what sort of stuff you taking? Just pot, I hope. Nothing too hard?
Oct 17, 2016, 12:18 AM

I can't play it high tho, it's too much effort

Scream no! And storm out. Or do a Peter Finch. "I'm as mad as hell, and I'm not gonna take it anymore!"
Oct 17, 2016, 12:13 AM

Oct 17, 2016, 12:13 AM

Story of my life 😢
Oct 17, 2016, 12:12 AM
Callum Davies
"So anyway, here's Wonderwall" 😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:12 AM
George Hughes
When you have a crowd of like 50 people yelling wonderwall at you, what do you do?
Oct 17, 2016, 12:12 AM
George Hughes
Yep, it's like a disease I can't get rid of
Oct 17, 2016, 12:12 AM
Callum Davies
I was literally just typing that!
Oct 17, 2016, 12:11 AM
George Hughes
I've played it no less than 80 times in my time here
Oct 17, 2016, 12:11 AM
George Hughes
Basically.. The worst thing about it is: Wonderwall!!
Oct 17, 2016, 12:11 AM
Callum Davies
Good to hear. So you're that one guy at uni with the guitar? 😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:11 AM
George Hughes
Mainly cause I go around playing guitar and entertaining folk.. But yeah I buy drinks where it's due 😝
Oct 17, 2016, 12:10 AM
Callum Davies
I hope you've been putting in your rounds though. Like a true man.
Oct 17, 2016, 12:10 AM
George Hughes
I've been given a lot, I mean a lot of free drinks tho
Oct 17, 2016, 12:09 AM
Callum Davies
No, not to bad at all.
Oct 17, 2016, 12:09 AM
George Hughes
6 weeks. So not too bad
Oct 17, 2016, 12:09 AM
Callum Davies
In what timespan?
Oct 17, 2016, 12:09 AM
George Hughes
Must have spent at least a hundred on drinks tho 😢
Oct 17, 2016, 12:08 AM
Callum Davies
Furry 😋
Oct 17, 2016, 12:08 AM
Callum Davies
Off cheap bear?
Oct 17, 2016, 12:08 AM
George Hughes
Sometimes lager
Oct 17, 2016, 12:08 AM
George Hughes
Oh no I'm not going to do that 😂 i get drunk off cheap bear and Glenn's vodka 😖
Oct 17, 2016, 12:08 AM
Callum Davies
Okay. Oh, and by the way, I'm not saying it's bad, but if you are looking to get drunk, I wouldn't be looking to do it on single malts. You'll run yourself up a very large drinks bill! 😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:07 AM
George Hughes
It's okay bud, my sleeping patterns are way more fucked 🙄😂 I don't know what to call it, I mean I've just asked her out and she's said yeah
Oct 17, 2016, 12:05 AM
Callum Davies
And is Rosie your new, friend? I'm not sure what you're calling it yet.
Oct 17, 2016, 12:03 AM
Callum Davies
I need to be up for work in 6 hours! 😂 That is, if I had ever been asleep tonight. I swear I haven't slept in like 72 hours 😂
Oct 17, 2016, 12:03 AM
George Hughes
Sorry I took ages there, Rosie was explaining her homework to me
Oct 17, 2016, 12:03 AM
George Hughes
Aw thanks 😉 drunk me is very reckless tho, surprise surprise
Oct 17, 2016, 12:02 AM
Callum Davies
The night was just awful. I need to choose better company next time. Like you 😊
Oct 16, 2016, 11:59 PM
George Hughes
Meh the throwing up part isn't great but if you've had a good night before that, you'll wake up remembering it to be great
Oct 16, 2016, 11:58 PM
Callum Davies
Talking to some Russians we had met on the street outside a bar. That Bar actually. I was drunk, and scared. I ended being sick on the bus on the way back, in front of people I knew. Was not a pleasant experience for me. I didn't like the loss of control of both my mind and body. Personally, I didn't enjoy it. But, each to their own 😉
Oct 16, 2016, 11:56 PM
George Hughes
Where did you end up that night?
Oct 16, 2016, 11:54 PM
George Hughes
Yep we all do it.. Difference seems to be I enjoy being shitfaced 💁🏼
Oct 16, 2016, 11:53 PM
Callum Davies
So I guess you're right about having to go through an irresponsible phase! And I'm under no delusion that that'll be the last time that happens. 😂 But I'll try to be sensible from now on
Oct 16, 2016, 11:53 PM
Callum Davies
And oh, by the way. I went T total for about a fortnight. I went out one night, and got completely smashed. I did not enjoy it very much, from what I can remember of it. So for about a fortnight after, I didn't touch a drop as a result! I'm back to a sensible amount now though, although I have cut back a bit from what I used to do; just becuase of work.
Oct 16, 2016, 11:51 PM
George Hughes
It'll definitely last tho, I can make things I enjoy last, I've made a big galaxy bar last two weeks 😝 that's a fairly substantial amount still, but yeah in case I don't like it
Oct 16, 2016, 11:48 PM
Callum Davies
But I don't want to get you a full bottle, in case you don't like it 😉
Oct 16, 2016, 11:48 PM
Callum Davies
A standard whiskey bottle is 70cl by the way. So a 35cl is a half bottle

Hey, a small 35cl bottle wont be too expensive. I'd offer you a taste of ours at home, but that's dad's 😂
Oct 16, 2016, 11:47 PM
George Hughes
Gotta think of something to get you 🤔
Oct 16, 2016, 11:46 PM
George Hughes
Aww you don't have to 😅
Oct 16, 2016, 11:46 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, I'll save up and get you one. Late birthday present 😉
Oct 16, 2016, 11:45 PM
George Hughes
Sucks being 17 😢
Oct 16, 2016, 11:45 PM
George Hughes
You know your stuff 🍺 I'll get someone to buy me a small bottle of Talisker and see how that goes down
Oct 16, 2016, 11:44 PM
Callum Davies
Talisker is my favourite. But that's a very acquired taste; very peaty. That's made on the Isla of Skye. Jura is also very good, especially Jura Superstition. That's made on the Isle of Jura, funnily enough. Another good one is Oban; guess where that's made. Also, Glen Moray, Glen Fiddich, and Aberlour.

George Hughes
😝😝
Oct 16, 2016, 11:39 PM
George Hughes
Btw this is not George, this is his higher self
Oct 16, 2016, 11:39 PM
George Hughes
I needed to go through my phase of abusing it, which I still do.. Last night was incredible 😂
Oct 16, 2016, 11:39 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, I'll give you some of my recommendations
Oct 16, 2016, 11:38 PM
Callum Davies
George Hughes has a girlfriend and is starting to appreciate drink? I feel like I'm entering the Twilight Zone! 😜
Oct 16, 2016, 11:38 PM
George Hughes
Like for enjoyment 😝
Oct 16, 2016, 11:38 PM
George Hughes
Kinda want something quality for nights when I don't get drunk
Oct 16, 2016, 11:38 PM
Callum Davies
!?😳
Oct 16, 2016, 11:37 PM
George Hughes
Can you recommend me any single malt whiskeys?
Oct 16, 2016, 11:37 PM
George Hughes
Yep but there's always time to have a drink😏
Oct 16, 2016, 11:36 PM
Callum Davies
Will you not be busy with, well, Christmas?
Oct 16, 2016, 11:35 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha yeah😂
Oct 16, 2016, 11:35 PM
George Hughes
Feel like hanging over on Christmas Day? 😝
Oct 16, 2016, 11:34 PM
Callum Davies
If not, I'm bloody quitting at Christmas
Oct 16, 2016, 11:34 PM
Callum Davies
I fucking hope so!
Oct 16, 2016, 11:34 PM
George Hughes
Look at you, working man 😎
Oct 16, 2016, 11:34 PM
George Hughes
You get Christmas off? 😉
Oct 16, 2016, 11:34 PM
Callum Davies
I've adapted. I'll be well used to it by Christmas
Oct 16, 2016, 11:34 PM
Callum Davies
I probably will have to, but when else will we get a chance? I very rarely get 2 days in a row off!
Oct 16, 2016, 11:33 PM
George Hughes
I shall, but once I'm back, we can just hang about whenever, assuming you don't have to get up for work the next day 😝😎
Oct 16, 2016, 11:32 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, message me a date once you know when 😉
Oct 16, 2016, 11:31 PM
George Hughes
That's very reasonable however it must be pretty exhausting 😅 well I'll be back like a week before Christmas probs cause I think that's when the exams end
Oct 16, 2016, 11:29 PM
Callum Davies
Not an awful lot. Working at the local factory. It's minimum wage, if I was 21 years old! £6.70 an hour, 37.5 hours a week. And it's a 5 minute walk from my house, so no travel costs. That's roughly £250 per week, or about £1000/month. Not to be sniffed at. Also, do you know when you're back for Christmas? We've got a pub and catch up date to do 😉
Oct 16, 2016, 8:40 PM
George Hughes
What've you been up to?
Oct 16, 2016, 8:34 PM
George Hughes
Haha true dat😆 thanks 😄
Oct 16, 2016, 8:33 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, maybe I'm going overboard there. It takes months if not years to gauge whether you want to spend your life with someone, and your relationship is still in its infancy. But I'm just glad you seem to have found someone😊
Oct 16, 2016, 8:16 PM
George Hughes
Hmm dunno how I feel about that 😐
Oct 16, 2016, 7:03 PM
Callum Davies
I hope you've found someone you'll be with for a long time. Maybe your whole life! 😍😜
Oct 16, 2016, 6:40 PM
George Hughes
Cheers bud 😅
Oct 16, 2016, 1:45 PM
Callum Davies
I'm glad for you😁
Oct 16, 2016, 9:25 AM
George Hughes
It was great 😝
Oct 16, 2016, 12:11 AM
George Hughes
Well we went to the museum and we had coffee and scones 😅
Oct 16, 2016, 12:10 AM
Callum Davies
How'd it go?
Oct 15, 2016, 11:56 PM
George Hughes
You know that girl I was talking about? I asked her out 😎
Oct 15, 2016, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
Haha yeah
Sep 23, 2016, 5:36 PM
Callum Davies
I'm taking the piss
Sep 23, 2016, 5:34 PM
Callum Davies
I know
Sep 23, 2016, 5:34 PM
George Hughes
We were more doing it for bantz, something to do 😝
Sep 23, 2016, 5:34 PM
Callum Davies
C'mon George, pub quizzes are a serious matter! 😂
Sep 23, 2016, 5:34 PM
Callum Davies
Well, that was your first mistake there
Sep 23, 2016, 5:33 PM
George Hughes
Nope haha we had a lot of sciencey peeps
Sep 23, 2016, 5:33 PM
Callum Davies
It's only a pub quiz. It's not bloody University Challenge! Anyway, didn't you spread specialist subjects? Have a science guy, art guy, etc
Sep 23, 2016, 5:33 PM
George Hughes
We're specialist, not generalist
Sep 23, 2016, 5:32 PM
George Hughes
Yep 😆
Sep 23, 2016, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
A group of university students "weren't that smart"?
Sep 23, 2016, 5:31 PM
George Hughes
Nah haha we weren't that smart
Sep 23, 2016, 5:31 PM
Callum Davies
Did you win?
Sep 23, 2016, 5:15 PM
George Hughes
Sorry I never messaged after, went to a pub quiz and stuff
Sep 23, 2016, 1:33 PM
George Hughes
It was good thanks haha
Sep 23, 2016, 1:33 PM
Callum Davies
Did you have a good working out endeavour?
Sep 23, 2016, 10:33 AM
George Hughes
Hey, I'm literally just about to head out to the gym haha
Sep 22, 2016, 5:48 PM
Callum Davies
Hello
Sep 22, 2016, 5:44 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers
Sep 21, 2016, 8:14 PM
George Hughes
Brilliant well done 😎
Sep 21, 2016, 8:14 PM
Callum Davies
And it's a date. 7pm at the Sandeman this Saturday
Sep 21, 2016, 8:12 PM
George Hughes
Thank you 👌🏼
Sep 21, 2016, 8:10 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers  You get a punch in the face as well
Sep 21, 2016, 8:08 PM
George Hughes
Great 👊🏼🎉
Sep 21, 2016, 8:07 PM
Callum Davies
almost, I'm just waiting to hear when she's free
Sep 21, 2016, 8:07 PM
George Hughes
Good good, you set up a date?
Sep 21, 2016, 8:06 PM
Callum Davies
Things seem to be going well with Laura
Sep 21, 2016, 8:04 PM
George Hughes
Fair dos haha
Sep 21, 2016, 8:02 PM
Callum Davies
I just type like I speak, and I usually cut off the first bit. I usually say 'king
Sep 21, 2016, 7:19 PM
George Hughes
Oh right 🙄😂 say fucking btw , no ones gonna mind😝
Sep 21, 2016, 7:18 PM
Callum Davies
It's 'king freezing in here!
Sep 21, 2016, 7:17 PM
Callum Davies
I've since taught myself to calm down
Sep 21, 2016, 7:16 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not worried. I'm just mocking how I used to be like that
Sep 21, 2016, 7:16 PM
George Hughes
I'm the only person in the flat who's not locked themselves out 😏 and nah she'll be offline don't worry
Sep 21, 2016, 7:15 PM
Callum Davies
Either she's offline, or has turned chat off for me! Fun! :P
Sep 21, 2016, 7:15 PM
Callum Davies
Hurray for logic!
Sep 21, 2016, 7:14 PM
George Hughes
Logic is fun 😄
Sep 21, 2016, 7:13 PM
George Hughes
App inventor which is shit, touched on "hello world" in Java but I decided to learn more so I know a lot of the basic structure for it now, and propositional logic in maths
Sep 21, 2016, 7:13 PM
Callum Davies
So anyway, while we wait for this to develop, what sort of stuff are you currently doing in your course?
Sep 21, 2016, 7:12 PM
Callum Davies
I am
Sep 21, 2016, 7:11 PM
George Hughes
Aw right, give her a while then
Sep 21, 2016, 7:11 PM
Callum Davies
She's offline just now. Hasn't seen the message yet
Sep 21, 2016, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
Yeah it probably is
Sep 21, 2016, 7:10 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, she said "Was there something else" Surely that's a come-on if ever I heard one, right?
Sep 21, 2016, 7:09 PM
Callum Davies
Yup
Sep 21, 2016, 7:09 PM
George Hughes
Haha it's kinda excitement as well as nerves
Sep 21, 2016, 7:08 PM
Callum Davies
I said: "Yeah. Would you maybe want to try again sometime? At a nice, quiet pub this time! "
Sep 21, 2016, 7:08 PM
Callum Davies
'king hell, I must be nervous. I can feel my heart thumping against my ribcage
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
George Hughes
What're you saying?
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
George Hughes
Dunno what she means
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Let's see
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Nothing ventured, nothing gained
Sep 21, 2016, 7:07 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah. Would you maybe want to try again sometime? At a nice, quiet pub this time! 
Sep 21, 2016, 7:06 PM
Callum Davies
Sent this
Sep 21, 2016, 7:06 PM
Callum Davies
She just said "Was there something else?"
Sep 21, 2016, 7:06 PM
George Hughes
Yeah ask that, but with the 😊 instead of :)
Sep 21, 2016, 7:06 PM
Callum Davies
She just said "Right okay"
Sep 21, 2016, 7:05 PM
George Hughes
Maybe wait and see what she replies first 😄
Sep 21, 2016, 7:05 PM
Callum Davies
Should I say something like "Do you maybe want to try again? At a nice, quiet pub this time! :)"
Sep 21, 2016, 7:03 PM
George Hughes
Looks good
Sep 21, 2016, 7:02 PM
Callum Davies
I know it may be a little late for this, but can I apologise for my poor choice of venue when we went out? [?]
Sep 21, 2016, 7:01 PM
Callum Davies
Sent this:
Sep 21, 2016, 7:01 PM
George Hughes
Ahh, hope it goes well 😄
Sep 21, 2016, 7:01 PM
Callum Davies
typing the message
Sep 21, 2016, 7:00 PM
George Hughes
Any luck?
Sep 21, 2016, 7:00 PM
Callum Davies
That's what I'm doing, right now
Sep 21, 2016, 7:00 PM
George Hughes
Aw man, yeah she looked pretty bored there, try and get a second chance somewhere nicer 😝
Sep 21, 2016, 7:00 PM
Callum Davies
I suppose. I've been pretty lonely lately :'( But Laura seems to be intermittently on and off here, so I may as well try to patch things up with her. Try to apologise for the poor choice of venue last time; no comment on your music. It was just loud
Sep 21, 2016, 6:59 PM
George Hughes
Just when it happens
Sep 21, 2016, 6:57 PM
Callum Davies
Seriously!? When you planning to seal the deal, man?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:57 PM
George Hughes
Just making out haha,
well I have been working up to harder runs 😆
Sep 21, 2016, 6:56 PM
Callum Davies
But look at me being all romantic! So, have there been any developments on the 'making out with random chicks' front? And yeah, congrats! Just goes to show what you can achieve when you don't me slowing you down!
Sep 21, 2016, 6:53 PM
George Hughes
In other news did you see on the chat about the run I did the other day?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:52 PM
George Hughes
Yeah exactly haha 🙄
Sep 21, 2016, 6:51 PM
Callum Davies
Eh, open relationship? And also, if you don't want to, then you probably shouldn't. You should want to put in the effort and be willing to dedicate yourself to them. It's pointless if you don't want them.
Sep 21, 2016, 6:49 PM
George Hughes
Nah it's not a case of courage, I just don't want to dedicate to a person; partly cause its effort and partly cause I can't make out with random chicks on the dance floor lol
Sep 21, 2016, 6:47 PM
Callum Davies
Nah, take the plunge. A little Dutch Courage can't hurt beforehand
Sep 21, 2016, 6:43 PM
George Hughes
Naw I kinda like her but I'm not wanting to start anything
Sep 21, 2016, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
:P
Sep 21, 2016, 6:42 PM
Callum Davies
Just promise I'll be best man, yeah?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:41 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, I knew it! I'm happy for you
Sep 21, 2016, 6:41 PM
George Hughes
There is no such thing 😱😝
Sep 21, 2016, 6:40 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, you so do! What else could turn you to the idea of a relationship but loveeeeeee!
Sep 21, 2016, 6:39 PM
George Hughes
Hmm kinda but nah haha
Sep 21, 2016, 6:38 PM
Callum Davies
So, you coming around to the idea, eh? I think you have your eye on someone
Sep 21, 2016, 6:35 PM
George Hughes
I'm not too fussed tbh hahaha
Sep 21, 2016, 6:35 PM
Callum Davies
I thought you didn't want a gf?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Maybe it'll happen soon then haha
Sep 21, 2016, 6:33 PM
Callum Davies
Doesn't take long, so I hear. Not in uni
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
Nah haha
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
Soo, your 2-3 weeks into uni now. Got a girlfriend?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
😂😂😂
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
Ahhhhhh
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
George Hughes
Why do you think that?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
It's just giving it's opinion on its creator
Sep 21, 2016, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
I think my laptop hates facebook
Sep 21, 2016, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha I'll give uni a chance, the maths looks like it's gonna get interesting 😝 classic autocorrect 🙄😂
Sep 21, 2016, 6:31 PM
Callum Davies
*red lines
Sep 21, 2016, 6:31 PM
Callum Davies
Also, 'Zuckerburg' was in read lines for me, and when I went to correct it, the correction was 'cocksucker'!
Sep 21, 2016, 6:30 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha. You're going to the next Gates or Zuckerberg; they dropped out of college because it was too easy!
Sep 21, 2016, 6:29 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha good to be busy tho, and kinda, but the stuff we're doing rn is too easy and a bit dull, I've resorted to doing other people's homework
Sep 21, 2016, 6:28 PM
Callum Davies
Sorry, my life has been a bit hectic. I have trouble realising when a week has passed. I mostly count my life in hours now! So, down to proper learning and studying for you now
Sep 21, 2016, 6:27 PM
George Hughes
It's been amazing, freshers week ended a while ago, but it's still been great craic
Sep 21, 2016, 6:26 PM
Callum Davies
So anyway, how's uni been? Is freshers' week over yet?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:25 PM
George Hughes
😂😂
Sep 21, 2016, 6:25 PM
Callum Davies
That's why I asked
Sep 21, 2016, 6:25 PM
George Hughes
Yep totally sober, unlike most of the time 😝
Sep 21, 2016, 6:24 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, straight off the bat, so I know what I'm dealing with, are you sober right now?
Sep 21, 2016, 6:22 PM
George Hughes
Hey
Sep 21, 2016, 6:22 PM
Callum Davies
Hello
Sep 21, 2016, 6:21 PM
George Hughes
Exactly 😝🍺
Sep 5, 2016, 12:01 PM
Callum Davies
And cheap beer at the student union bar 😉
Sep 5, 2016, 10:56 AM
George Hughes
Well my gran bought me cider and my new mate gave me vodka 😎
Sep 4, 2016, 11:07 AM
Callum Davies
You've been there for one day! How? Did you just pop your bags down and whip out a bottle of vodka!? It's almost impressive. Almost.
Sep 4, 2016, 10:53 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha just a bit 😆 sorry I went for a run/explore, running is awful during a hangover 😢
Sep 4, 2016, 10:35 AM
Callum Davies
I don't know, I'm a bit all over the place at the moment, to be perfectly honest.
Sep 4, 2016, 9:56 AM
Callum Davies
*ill disposed
Sep 4, 2016, 9:55 AM
Callum Davies
And I suppose, hypothetically, if should choose to, on occasion, share such material with me, I may not be too I'll disposed towards such activities. 😜
Sep 4, 2016, 9:50 AM
Callum Davies
I'm just wondering why you chose to focus on my being bi was all. Just how many of these sorts of pictures do you get sent?
Sep 4, 2016, 9:47 AM
George Hughes
Means you like girls as well 😂
Sep 4, 2016, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
*very much doubt
Sep 4, 2016, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
What's my being bi got to do with it? I very doubt you have any hot guys sending you pictures 😜
Sep 4, 2016, 9:45 AM
George Hughes
Cause you're a bi guy, so you might appreciate it
Sep 4, 2016, 9:44 AM
Callum Davies
Why?
Sep 4, 2016, 9:42 AM
George Hughes
Coz you might enjoy it
Sep 4, 2016, 7:57 AM
Callum Davies
Anyway?
Sep 3, 2016, 7:34 PM
Callum Davies
Why did you send me this and?
Sep 3, 2016, 7:34 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough.
Sep 3, 2016, 7:33 PM
George Hughes
Kirsty Mcalpine I think, I don't know her
Sep 3, 2016, 7:30 PM
Callum Davies
Who even is that?
Sep 3, 2016, 7:28 PM
George Hughes
Got back home and found this in my inbox, not gonna complain
Sep 2, 2016, 11:09 PM
George Hughes

Sep 2, 2016, 11:09 PM
Callum Davies
I remember that
Sep 2, 2016, 6:44 PM
Callum Davies
Yup
Sep 2, 2016, 6:44 PM
George Hughes
Found this XD
Sep 2, 2016, 6:23 PM
George Hughes

Sep 2, 2016, 6:23 PM
George Hughes
I'm pretty much done packing 😮
Sep 2, 2016, 1:41 PM
Callum Davies
Okay 😜
Sep 2, 2016, 1:12 PM
George Hughes
I don't want to ruin a good set of spares
Sep 2, 2016, 1:11 PM
Callum Davies
And you'll also need a pair for yourself tonight, in case you get legless!
Sep 2, 2016, 1:06 PM
George Hughes
I'll bring a pair tonight
Sep 2, 2016, 1:06 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha I understand your pain.. However I don't feel it right now 😝😂
Sep 2, 2016, 1:05 PM
Callum Davies
You owe me a new pair of legs, because you've broken these ones!
Sep 2, 2016, 1:03 PM
Callum Davies
Cheers 😁
Sep 1, 2016, 2:27 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's fine
Sep 1, 2016, 2:26 PM
Callum Davies
I left my water bottle at your house. I'll pick it up tomorrow?
Sep 1, 2016, 2:26 PM
Callum Davies
I'm just coming up on your street. I'll see you soon
Sep 1, 2016, 12:36 PM
Callum Davies
Gotcha 😉
Sep 1, 2016, 12:35 PM
George Hughes
Yep dats right
Sep 1, 2016, 12:35 PM
Callum Davies
Oh yea, the "I really miss doing heroin" one
Sep 1, 2016, 12:35 PM
George Hughes
I'll send it if I can find it
Sep 1, 2016, 12:34 PM
Callum Davies
That wasn't auto-correct actually. That's just what I was expecting you to say. Because of auto-correct. And which screenshot?
Sep 1, 2016, 12:34 PM
George Hughes
I showed you that screenshot didn't I?
Sep 1, 2016, 12:34 PM
George Hughes
Yep... I miss smoking weed
Sep 1, 2016, 12:33 PM
Callum Davies
What an absolute shave!
Sep 1, 2016, 12:33 PM
Callum Davies
You're auto-correct really has it in for you, doesn't it?
Sep 1, 2016, 12:33 PM
George Hughes
What a save 😮😮😮
Sep 1, 2016, 12:33 PM
George Hughes
Nor
Sep 1, 2016, 12:33 PM
George Hughes
And not should you
Sep 1, 2016, 12:33 PM
George Hughes
But I don't
Sep 1, 2016, 12:32 PM
George Hughes
Bo worries 😆
Sep 1, 2016, 12:32 PM
Callum Davies
I may be a little later than expected, the bus came a little late
Sep 1, 2016, 12:32 PM
Callum Davies
My little boy is growing up so fast 😪
Sep 1, 2016, 12:31 PM
George Hughes
Thank you, you must be so proud 😄😄😄
Sep 1, 2016, 12:30 PM
Callum Davies
You managed to put clothes on your body. Well done! 👏🏻
Sep 1, 2016, 12:29 PM
Callum Davies
Yay! 🙌🏻
Sep 1, 2016, 12:29 PM
George Hughes
Awesome, got ma running kit on 😆
Sep 1, 2016, 12:29 PM
Callum Davies
Also that's me on the bus now
Sep 1, 2016, 12:25 PM
Callum Davies
I only have two words for you: silly moo!
Sep 1, 2016, 12:23 PM
George Hughes
I suppose there are a few nerves, but I killed them last night when I burnt my hand on a clay pot
Sep 1, 2016, 12:22 PM
Callum Davies
I know. I was just wondering if you were feeling nervous and excited. I know I would be!
Sep 1, 2016, 12:19 PM
George Hughes
Not especially, but the nerves will come on the day, or they won't come at all. It's just excitement to get away at the moment 👌🏼

Spirits are the least calorific, given that they're distilled rather than fermented.
Aug 25, 2016, 3:40 PM
George Hughes
Well I had three during the family barbecue 😂 but I get what you mean, vodka does feel emptier than cider
Aug 25, 2016, 3:40 PM

Beer, cider, wine, are actually all really high calorie. Have you never felt really bloated after a pint? I know I have. 🙂
Aug 25, 2016, 3:39 PM

Really? Ahh 😂
Aug 25, 2016, 3:38 PM

I'm sure there's less calories in cider than in most other drinks

That would only serve to gain the calories you just burned off, surely. Alcohol is very high calorie
Aug 25, 2016, 3:35 PM
George Hughes
😝😂
Aug 25, 2016, 3:35 PM
George Hughes
Yeah true, maybe a sip of vodka for every ten press ups
Aug 25, 2016, 3:35 PM
Callum Davies
I know, you'd just have to switch it for a trigger that works personally for you
Aug 25, 2016, 3:33 PM
George Hughes
I don't think the video games one would work for me tho 😢
Aug 25, 2016, 3:32 PM
George Hughes
That's actually a really smart idea! 😮😅
Aug 25, 2016, 3:32 PM
Callum Davies
Plus, it's got a psychological advantage also. Every time I touch my nose, it makes the sound of a coin being got in Mario. And when I've finished my sets, it plays the end level music from Mario, also. I know it sounds silly, but I've played video games my whole life. One of the things that I most associate with achievement is finishing a level on a video game. For example, Mario. So it actually has a subconscious trigger for me. Plus the added benefit that it just makes the workouts fun. I'm getting coins with my nose! Whee! 😁💰
Aug 25, 2016, 3:28 PM
Callum Davies
And I've also got this cool thing on my phone, where I can count my press ups with it, and I touch it with my nose to count a push up. So, not only do I not have to count my press ups, meaning I can instead concentrate on proper form. But also because I have to touch my nose to the floor, it enclosed the fullest range of movement within the exercise, meaning that the maximum number of muscle groups are targeted! Neat, right?
Aug 25, 2016, 3:22 PM
Callum Davies
Yuh, I'm looking forward to it. 😛
Aug 25, 2016, 3:18 PM
George Hughes
It'll be fun 😆😄
Aug 25, 2016, 3:17 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, I'll wear my trainers then. Perfect!
Aug 25, 2016, 3:17 PM
George Hughes
Nope, all road, good surface
Aug 25, 2016, 3:16 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, as I say, I'll be prepared. How's the underfoot on the passage? Is it very muddy?
Aug 25, 2016, 3:16 PM
George Hughes
😝😝
Aug 25, 2016, 3:15 PM
George Hughes
And he held cycling records
Aug 25, 2016, 3:15 PM
George Hughes
If you can do it in twenty minutes, you'd be fitter than my dad ever was
Aug 25, 2016, 3:15 PM
George Hughes
The first mile is easy, then you get to the first uphill, that takes longer than 5 mins for sure
Aug 25, 2016, 3:15 PM
Callum Davies
Try 20 mins, then you're talking. I reckon I could tackle a mile every 5 mins
Aug 25, 2016, 3:14 PM
George Hughes
I'm glad you think so, I'm looking forward to seeing you prove how easy it is 😝
Aug 25, 2016, 3:13 PM
Callum Davies
Four miles? In 45 mins? Easy! 😏
Aug 25, 2016, 3:13 PM
George Hughes
About 4 miles of uphill/downhill
Aug 25, 2016, 3:13 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough. How far is the dron passage?
Aug 25, 2016, 3:12 PM
George Hughes
If you knew what mine was like, then you'd know you could easily surpass it 😂 trust me I'm not that fit
Aug 25, 2016, 3:12 PM
Callum Davies
A week? I don't think I can totally train my cardiovascular system to the point that yours is in a week! Basic biology!
Aug 25, 2016, 3:11 PM

You've got a week to prepare 😏😝 also that's a lovely image
Aug 25, 2016, 3:10 PM

Aug 25, 2016, 2:46 PM

Cool. But it might have to be more of a light saunter for you. You're a lot fitter than I, and although I'm trying to get fitter, it'll take time
Aug 25, 2016, 2:36 PM
George Hughes
Sure
Aug 25, 2016, 2:35 PM

I can be in Brig for about 12:30 - 35, is that okay?

Ah well, it'll be extra good workout. Yuh, I should be able to do next Thursday
Aug 25, 2016, 2:11 PM

Next Thursday maybe?
Aug 25, 2016, 2:11 PM

And the dron is a 45 minute run

Can't, I'm working on Monday. But I can on Tuesday
Aug 25, 2016, 1:08 PM
George Hughes
If it's still going well on Monday, fancy coming out here for a run round the dron?
Aug 25, 2016, 12:36 PM
George Hughes
Glad to hear it 👌🏼
Aug 25, 2016, 12:21 PM

Aug 22, 2016, 5:41 PM
George Hughes
But you'll end up having to watch me eat tea
Aug 22, 2016, 5:41 PM
George Hughes
Up to you
Aug 22, 2016, 5:41 PM
Callum Davies
You don't want me yet?
Aug 22, 2016, 5:40 PM
George Hughes
We can hang out for a while before tea
Aug 22, 2016, 5:40 PM
George Hughes
Cool

Fucking bus timetable changes!
Aug 22, 2016, 5:31 PM
Callum Davies
I don't know!
Aug 22, 2016, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
Alright, well, mum's told me "we'll sort it out when i get home". We'll apparently sort it in the 10 minutes I'm in, then ill miss my bus, then she'll be angry!
Aug 22, 2016, 5:29 PM
George Hughes
No idea, my parents need to get back, cook tea, then eat then I can come out
Aug 22, 2016, 5:27 PM
Callum Davies
How soon after 6 do you reckon?
Aug 22, 2016, 5:27 PM
George Hughes
Ahh 😕 well just whatever works but I may not be able to come out until after 6 cause food
Aug 22, 2016, 5:24 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then. But you realise that I'll have very little time to get ready. I'll literally have 20 mins at home, if that!
Aug 22, 2016, 5:13 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that'd work
Aug 22, 2016, 5:12 PM
Callum Davies
Okay, so should I take the later bus then?
Aug 22, 2016, 5:12 PM
George Hughes
Well my folks are away out buying tea so we should be fed by quarter to 7
Aug 22, 2016, 5:10 PM
Callum Davies
Hi, I've just realised that the last bus to Brig is at 18:26. So we may have to begin the night at 6:45. Or, I could stop of the bus I'm taking from town, which arrives at about 5:40. We could make it a long night?
Aug 22, 2016, 5:09 PM
George Hughes
Noooo
Aug 22, 2016, 5:04 PM
Callum Davies
The Kyle is resisting
Aug 22, 2016, 5:03 PM

Do it
Aug 22, 2016, 5:02 PM

I'll kidnap him
Aug 22, 2016, 5:01 PM
George Hughes
Cooool
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
Callum Davies
I'll ask him now. He seems to be online
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
By whatever means necessary
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
And if he doesn't, persuade him
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
George Hughes
Awesome! And cheers! Yeah see if he wants to come along
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
Callum Davies
Should I invite Kyle?
Aug 22, 2016, 5:00 PM
Callum Davies
You got it. I'll see ya then. I'll bug the first round, since you got it last time.
Aug 22, 2016, 4:59 PM

Maybe 8ish again or something?
Aug 22, 2016, 4:58 PM

I don't believe in foreplay, It's easier when both parties know the intentions of the other
Aug 22, 2016, 4:57 PM

Very forward of you. Have you not heard of foreplay? 😜
Aug 22, 2016, 4:56 PM

Aug 22, 2016, 10:35 AM

That sounds awesome! I'm thinking of starting a jazz band at some point 😝gtg now, chat later
Aug 22, 2016, 10:34 AM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, yeah. Listen to the song Take 5 by Dave Brubeck. It has a 4 minute drum solo
Aug 22, 2016, 10:34 AM
George Hughes
Just think how long it would have been if we had a drummer
Aug 22, 2016, 10:32 AM
Callum Davies
You went busking for 8 hours. 3 songs were played
Aug 22, 2016, 10:31 AM
George Hughes
Guitar and sax, weird combo but it works
Aug 22, 2016, 10:31 AM
George Hughes
Talking of saxophone, I went busking with Fraser and he brought his saxophone and we played blues songs with him doing improv sax solos 👌🏼👌🏼👌🏼
Aug 22, 2016, 10:30 AM
Callum Davies
But you know what that song could have used more of? Saxophone. Needs more saxophone.

Eminem is an anagram of Illuminati, if you change some of the letters and add a few more, almost
Aug 22, 2016, 10:10 AM

I believe you have just given solid evidence to support the existence of the illuminati

You're like a white Eminem! 😜
Aug 22, 2016, 10:08 AM
George Hughes
I'll make a note of doing that next time I play it 😄
Aug 22, 2016, 10:07 AM
Callum Davies
You just need to concentrate on pronouncing the ends of the words at the quick bits. That's all
Aug 22, 2016, 10:07 AM
George Hughes
Also I'm not black or Eminem so I can't spit words that fast 😝
Aug 22, 2016, 10:06 AM

Kyle said the beat boxing kinda drowns out some of the quicker bits haha, thanks though, glad you like 😎😝
Aug 22, 2016, 10:06 AM

Sometimes it does sounds like you're scatting. Find it hard to make out what you're saying at some parts. Just saying. Other than that small quibble, it's great!

Only spent 30 mins on it so far, I'm away out to meet someone for busking today anyways 😂
Aug 15, 2016, 11:31 AM
Callum Davies
Yeah, ha ha. So how is the CryEngine coming along?
Aug 15, 2016, 10:12 AM
George Hughes
That would be pretty amusing, however... I have forgotten everything about blender and I'll be fairly busy once I've left home so I imagine it'll be a side project that may take a fair while to finish 😂
Aug 14, 2016, 10:13 PM
Callum Davies
It seems possible that we could use the CryEngine in tandem with Blender (which you of course already know how to use) to create character models and possibly render cutscenes.
Aug 14, 2016, 9:22 PM
Callum Davies
I know it was a silly joke at the beginning, but with the right spin on it, we might actually be able to turn Nazi Killer into a rather nice and subtle satire on the overuse of the Nazi Zombie trope. You've got the technical skills, I've got the game design knowledge, let's do it! 😃
Aug 14, 2016, 9:14 PM
George Hughes
I'll need to learn how to use it, otherwise, farewell nazi scum 😝
Aug 14, 2016, 8:34 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha. That throwaway fever dream of us lot making a game actually looks at least possible now. Now we just need an idea. I'm thinking Nazi Killer HD Remaster! 😜
Aug 14, 2016, 7:41 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I'm watching it now 😆😄
Aug 14, 2016, 7:38 PM
Callum Davies
Even so, I think the website has some video tutorials on it, so you might be able to get some tips from them.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:28 PM
Callum Davies
I just thought you'd be glad for a bit more than game maker, and I thought that if anyone has the know-how to use it, it's you.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:26 PM
George Hughes
That's all I'll be doing anyway so it's all good :P
Aug 14, 2016, 7:25 PM
Callum Davies
I think there's a whole licence complication if you release a game onto the market using the engine, and you're charging for it. The idea being that they're entitled to a sum because you're making money off their engine. But if you're using it for personal use, or release the games for free, then you're fine.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:22 PM
George Hughes
Wow it must be very decent then!
Aug 14, 2016, 7:19 PM
Callum Davies
Ubisoft use a heavily modified in-house version of the engine on their Far Cry games, so it must be decent.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:18 PM
George Hughes
First glance looks really cool!!
Aug 14, 2016, 7:17 PM
George Hughes
I'll take a look, thanks
Aug 14, 2016, 7:16 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, I don't know if this is of any interest to you, but if you ever fancy trying your hand at video games again, there's a royalty free professional game engine called CryEngine. You can pay as much or as little as you want for it. You can quite easily create an account, select the £/$0 option, and start coding.
Aug 14, 2016, 7:09 PM
George Hughes
Fair enough
Aug 14, 2016, 12:54 AM

No, I don't know what of. I just thought it's probably an anagram. Most things are..

Yeah just jk 😝 but there's usually always one girl in anime that dresses with clothes that bear resemblance to an animal
Aug 10, 2016, 4:59 PM
George Hughes
Just like you can never ün see Stephen waking as a potato
Aug 10, 2016, 4:58 PM

I think you're getting anime mixed up with hentai
Aug 10, 2016, 4:58 PM

Aug 10, 2016, 4:56 PM
George Hughes
Yep that was the programme
Aug 10, 2016, 4:55 PM
Callum Davies
Furries are people who like, or even get sexual pleasure from, dressing up as animals
Aug 10, 2016, 4:55 PM
George Hughes
That was awful
Aug 10, 2016, 4:55 PM

No, I shall land on your roof via helicopter, and rappel myself down the side of your wall, and smash my way into your front room feet first through the window, Mission Impossible style
Aug 10, 2016, 4:40 PM

Aug 10, 2016, 4:30 PM

Aug 9, 2016, 9:46 AM

Bro. You've passed all of your exams with high passes. And they don't even matter because you've got an unconditional anyway. You are in no position to complain
Aug 9, 2016, 9:45 AM
George Hughes
Yeah I have, A in music and Bs in computing and maths... That can't be right tho, I did better than that in computing I'm sure
Aug 9, 2016, 9:44 AM

Aug 9, 2016, 9:43 AM

Maybe you should swap to the parallel one were you get the best results 😝
Aug 9, 2016, 9:08 AM
Callum Davies

Aug 9, 2016, 9:07 AM
Callum Davies
Or, of course, if you're subscribed to the Heisenberg 'Many Worlds' interpretation, upon knowing my results, a parallel universe will be created in which the opposite outcome of the one in this universe occurs.
Aug 9, 2016, 9:06 AM
George Hughes
Not yet, keep them hanging there😮
Aug 9, 2016, 9:05 AM

My results now exist within two possible planes of existence. Should I turn off aeroplane mode and collapse them into one absolute existence? Schrödinger's results! 🐱

Callum Davies
Actually, it turned out a bit shit

Aug 9, 2016, 8:58 AM
Callum Davies
Wait, I've got the perfect MurphyBot question. I'll give him it, anf forward you the result. Okay, but make it sometime after about 2-3, because my phone is on aeroplane mode just now, and I have a driving lesson at 11:45. So you'll need to give me time to get home and get my results
Aug 9, 2016, 8:57 AM
George Hughes
I'll phone you at some point to chat about it
Aug 9, 2016, 8:55 AM

Aug 6, 2016, 4:27 PM
George Hughes
Heehee thanks 😆 night, see you tomorrow
Aug 5, 2016, 10:01 PM
Callum Davies
Sure, hope you make loads of moolah! 😜 I'm gunna head to bed now, so I'll see you on the bus tomorrow
Aug 5, 2016, 10:00 PM
George Hughes
Alrighty, that's fine, I might take my busking stuff in and play for a while once I've parted with you
Aug 5, 2016, 9:59 PM
Callum Davies
Or maybe even a little further? Better safe than me arrested! 😜 Anyway, also, I'll have to go once I've supplied you, because I also need to drop into Next to pick up a parcel and also go to the bank
Aug 5, 2016, 9:59 PM
George Hughes
I can just wait outside or whatever 😆
Aug 5, 2016, 9:57 PM
Callum Davies
Sounds good to me. I'll get the drink and then call you. We can meet up, and you can pay me, and I'll give you the goods. Yeah, but we'll have to separate. I don't want to be seen going into Tesco with you. They may suspect! We'll arrange something on the bus, I'm sure
Aug 5, 2016, 9:57 PM
George Hughes
Cause your bus goes through brig
Aug 5, 2016, 9:56 PM
George Hughes
Actually are you going in on the bus?
Aug 5, 2016, 9:56 PM
George Hughes
Ahh okay doke, half 12 then 😉
Aug 5, 2016, 9:55 PM
Callum Davies
Sorry
Aug 5, 2016, 9:55 PM
Callum Davies
No, got to be at the charity shop for 1:00. It has to be before
Aug 5, 2016, 9:55 PM
George Hughes
Noooo I'll be drinking it like a week before 🙄😂 I'll meet you 1ish if that's cool?
Aug 5, 2016, 9:54 PM
Callum Davies
You're going to drink an entire bottle of vodka, on your OWN, just before you first meet the people with whom you will be living and studying alongside for the next FOUR YEARS? Sure, that'll end well. 😏 Anyway, as I say, whatever you want. I'll be in town from about 12:15, I'll stop by the tesco metro and pick you up something. Bring money. And have your phone on you.
Aug 5, 2016, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
I'm not wanting it for uni, I'll drink it before I leave 😝 I will be in town tomorrow, but I'm meeting Kaitlin at 3ish
Aug 5, 2016, 9:50 PM
Callum Davies
For uni? Christ above 😞 Whatever. Actually, can you be in town tomorrow?
Aug 5, 2016, 9:48 PM
George Hughes
Aw man 😞 when are you next free? And there's no rush, as long as it's before I leave home 😝
Aug 5, 2016, 9:44 PM
Callum Davies
Nah. I'm not free Monday. Also, I won't be in town all of next week. When are you wanting the vodka for?
Aug 5, 2016, 9:38 PM
George Hughes
And good luck in your theory test 😎
Aug 5, 2016, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
And also lets go to the last cast again soon
Aug 5, 2016, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
Could you do me a huge favour and find me the cheapest full size bottle of vodka you can, and I'll pay you for it 😝😉 also check the group chat if you're free on Monday
Aug 5, 2016, 3:57 PM
George Hughes
Alrighty, have fun 😆 see you tomorrow
Aug 2, 2016, 7:30 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then. I'm going to have to go help Mum to cook dinner for now, but I'll see you tomorrow. Bye for now 😉
Aug 2, 2016, 7:30 PM
George Hughes
Awesaam, Merci beaucoup
Aug 2, 2016, 7:29 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then, I'll be sure to leave a key under the brown bristly mat just outside our front door.
Aug 2, 2016, 7:28 PM
George Hughes
If I take all of it, I might get a good amount for it 😝
Aug 2, 2016, 7:28 PM
Callum Davies
What expensive furniture!? 😜
Aug 2, 2016, 7:27 PM
George Hughes
If you're sure 😄 don't worry you can trust me not to run off with all your expensive furniture 😉
Aug 2, 2016, 7:21 PM
Callum Davies
Well, we might get home at 10 PAST 8. Maybe even half past. BUT, we've known you forever, we can trust you. If we leave you a key under the door mat, would you feel comfortable letting yourself in and maybe waiting at the house for half an hour for us to get in? Feel free to watch the telly and what have you
Aug 2, 2016, 7:13 PM
George Hughes
There's a bus that'll get me to Abernethy for 10 to 8 tomorrow, the timing couldn't be more perfect 😝
Aug 2, 2016, 3:02 PM
George Hughes
How about we do both 😝 I'm free tomorrow night, Friday night and pretty much every night after that until I leave for Edinburgh 😆
Aug 2, 2016, 12:46 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, why not? When were you thinking. Or, you could maybe come round here of a night; I think I may have some beers in the fridge
Aug 2, 2016, 8:07 AM
George Hughes
Fancy going to the pub again soon? I'm back from the hols now
Aug 1, 2016, 10:52 PM
George Hughes
Hahaha it was a pretty long stay tbf 😝😂
Jul 30, 2016, 6:24 PM

Yeah.. Have you heard Cameron's lament? The tune he whistled after he made his announcement that he was standing down
Jul 20, 2016, 10:23 AM
Callum Davies
Well, a good pm should serve as a voice of the people, and if the people call for an election...
Jul 20, 2016, 10:17 AM
George Hughes
Oh Ikr, mind you she's not gonna call one within months of her becoming pm
Jul 20, 2016, 10:16 AM
Callum Davies
And here's hoping that if she does call one, it's after December 2nd, so you can vote in it.
Jul 20, 2016, 10:14 AM
George Hughes
Yeah we can hope 
Jul 20, 2016, 10:13 AM
Callum Davies
But there are rumours of May calling a new General Election before 2020, aren't there? Here's hoping.
Jul 20, 2016, 10:12 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha yeah  she's the lesser of the evils or whatever
Jul 20, 2016, 10:10 AM
Callum Davies
I suppose. They reckon it was her, Boris, Osborne or Gove, don't they? I mean, Michael Gove's name alone is a grammatical error. "Michael GAVE. Not Gove. Gave!" 😜
Jul 20, 2016, 10:07 AM
George Hughes
Brb
Jul 20, 2016, 10:07 AM
George Hughes
Tbh she's the best person of all the choices that could have become PM
Jul 20, 2016, 10:05 AM
Callum Davies
Fuck you, May!

We don't get a say that it's stored in our country, let alone whether it exists or not
Jul 20, 2016, 10:05 AM
George Hughes
It SHOULD have been but again Westminster taking control of things that are far removed from them
Jul 20, 2016, 10:04 AM
Callum Davies
Wait! So Westminster had a say in the vote on trident? A purely Scottish matter! The vote should have been Hollyrood's, and Hollyrood's alone! 😡
Jul 20, 2016, 10:03 AM
George Hughes
We are, unless we become independant, then they can't keep nuclear weapons in our country
Jul 20, 2016, 10:02 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh, I see. We're all fucked
Jul 20, 2016, 10:01 AM
George Hughes
The rest of the scots were like fuck no
Jul 20, 2016, 10:01 AM
George Hughes
Only one scottish MP voted for...
Jul 20, 2016, 10:01 AM
Callum Davies
What? I thought only one MP voted for? Surely a bill cannot be passed on one vote?
Jul 20, 2016, 10:01 AM
George Hughes
I do love submarines, however not the nuclear ones that have been renewed...  yeah that is true, keep four seconds at least between you and the guy in front
Jul 20, 2016, 10:00 AM
Callum Davies
Yuh. Hey, do you like tangents? Well, at least it'll give me good practice in wet weather driving!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:58 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha they didn't need to commission a pool for the simple fact that they live in Scotland
Jul 20, 2016, 9:57 AM
Callum Davies
That's how my sister learnt to swim! "Come on, kids. It's raining outside. Swimming lessons!" 😜
Jul 20, 2016, 9:55 AM
George Hughes
Ahhh yeah I can see that happening
Jul 20, 2016, 9:54 AM
Callum Davies
Yuh. Well, not outside. We live at the top of a slope, so our house is usually fine. But the primary school, which is at the foot of the hill, is gonna be flooded. Lucky it's the holidays!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:54 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha is it actually that bad? You got a river outside? 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:52 AM
Callum Davies
I'm gunna step out the house and be swept off my feet by the wind. Wizard of Oz style! 😜

Ahh [?] have fun with that
Jul 20, 2016, 9:51 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh!!!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:50 AM
Callum Davies
Yup. Our estate is going to get flooded. Just like it always does in rain like this
Jul 20, 2016, 9:50 AM
George Hughes
Ahh, is there any rain now?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:50 AM
Callum Davies
A few weeks ago, that is. I'm home just now
Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
Callum Davies
I took that on the bus. That was just at the foot of your street
Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
George Hughes
Jeez
Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
George Hughes
I went driving for two hours in that rain 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
Callum Davies

Jul 20, 2016, 9:49 AM
Callum Davies
Oh, it's warm here. It's just thundering as well. It feels like I'm in the middle of a tropical storm! And yeah, I do
Jul 20, 2016, 9:48 AM
George Hughes
Remember that crazy rain we had last week?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:48 AM
George Hughes
Hahah aw man
Jul 20, 2016, 9:48 AM
George Hughes
It's already 23 degrees
Jul 20, 2016, 9:48 AM
Callum Davies
And I've got a driving lesson today! I'm going to die! 😩😭
Jul 20, 2016, 9:47 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha we've still got sun and bliss
Jul 20, 2016, 9:47 AM
Callum Davies
We haven't had a power cut yet, but I'm expecting one soon!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
Yuh, bad thunder
Jul 20, 2016, 9:46 AM
George Hughes
There's thunder apparantly?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:46 AM
George Hughes
Jeez Toma is complaining of power cuts as well 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
Also, the lights in my room just flickered. So there's a chance of a power cut soon, knowing Abernethy. So if I suddenly come offline, it's because we've had a power cut and the router's dead 😜
Jul 20, 2016, 9:44 AM
Callum Davies
Yuh. That's the thing. My tablet has GPS though. Don't you need an internet connection as well though?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:43 AM
George Hughes
Yeah, only problem is that it's a game that you play on the move with a gps signal
Jul 20, 2016, 9:42 AM
Callum Davies
I could try it on my tablet, which is obviously a little more powerful than my phone. But I can't be bothered to boot up my tablet. Maybe some time. I'll probably have a go tonight
Jul 20, 2016, 9:41 AM
George Hughes
Oh yeah the servers were down a lot but they're working fine now
Jul 20, 2016, 9:40 AM
Callum Davies
It said the servers were down. When I finally managed to get on, my phone froze on the first catch.
Jul 20, 2016, 9:40 AM
George Hughes
Aww man
Jul 20, 2016, 9:40 AM
Callum Davies
I can't even get it to work!
Jul 20, 2016, 9:39 AM
George Hughes
You caught any?
Jul 20, 2016, 9:39 AM
George Hughes
Lol  yeah that was cruel and disturbing 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:39 AM
Callum Davies
Anyway, did you see that Nyasha turned one of Beth's Pokémon into chicken nuggets? 😜
Jul 20, 2016, 9:37 AM
Callum Davies
I'm joking, of course. 😐
Jul 20, 2016, 9:37 AM
Callum Davies
BFFs! 😜
Jul 20, 2016, 9:36 AM
George Hughes
Aww don't worry you go easy on me, some of my mates rip into me a lot more, and I do the same to them  but yeah same, you're one of my besties 
Jul 20, 2016, 9:35 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh, mate. You know I say a lot of what I say in jest. Sometimes I think I maybe rip on you a little too much. For I joke and laugh, I really do consider you to be one of my best mates, you know. 😉
Jul 20, 2016, 7:45 AM
George Hughes
If you think I'm bad for not appreciating alcohol, you should see Malcolm and Callum... I'm on holiday in Whitby with them and they drink it out the bottle as fast as they possibly can while I've got a glass and I'm taking a drink every so often 🙄
Jul 19, 2016, 9:45 PM
George Hughes
Yeah man 😎
Jul 12, 2016, 7:21 PM
Callum Davies
It's just Kyle is all I'm thinking of. Be sure to let me know of your next open mic, and I'll try my best to be there 😉
Jul 12, 2016, 7:19 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I thought it might not be, but that's cool, make sure you invite me along some other time 
Jul 12, 2016, 7:18 PM
Callum Davies
Oh, I see. The trendy one in Perth. Nah, I think I'll give it a miss for now; not really Kyle's scene, is it? Besides, I don't mind visiting Bridge of Earn, but I don't really fancy hauling my ass all the way out to Perth on a weekday. Maybe some other time. 😉
Jul 12, 2016, 7:17 PM
George Hughes
That bar, you know
Jul 12, 2016, 7:14 PM
Callum Davies
Ah, alright then. Which bar is it?
Jul 12, 2016, 7:14 PM
George Hughes
You two should come maybe, it gets kinda busy but it'll be fun hopefully
Jul 12, 2016, 7:14 PM
George Hughes
Think I'm hosting the open mic at that bar with Malcolm and Callum
Jul 12, 2016, 7:13 PM
Callum Davies
Why not?
Jul 12, 2016, 7:13 PM
George Hughes
Actually I might not be able to make it tomorrow :(
Jul 12, 2016, 7:12 PM
George Hughes
Aw man, see you tomorrow
Jul 12, 2016, 7:12 PM
Callum Davies
Hopefully! Anyway, got to go now, I'll see you tomorrow
Jul 12, 2016, 7:12 PM
George Hughes
Good luck finding another one tho, once summer is over, it'll be much easier to find something good
Jul 12, 2016, 7:11 PM
Callum Davies
Yuh, probably. Ah well.
Jul 12, 2016, 7:06 PM
George Hughes
Jeez that's harsh  it won't be your fault tho, they'll be cutting back maybe
Jul 12, 2016, 7:06 PM
Callum Davies
Fuck knows, they just called me at 9:30 this morning and told not to bother coming in today.
Jul 12, 2016, 7:04 PM
George Hughes
Shit! How come??
Jul 12, 2016, 7:03 PM
Callum Davies
No, I lost my job 😞
Jul 12, 2016, 7:02 PM
George Hughes
Not much tbh, had the girl around earlier but she's just left, you done much today?
Jul 12, 2016, 7:01 PM
Callum Davies
Yuh, what's up with you?
Jul 12, 2016, 7:01 PM
George Hughes
Aw man, hate that feeling, chat tho 
Jul 12, 2016, 7:00 PM
Callum Davies
Okay then. I'm at a bit of a loose end, got nothing to do!
Jul 12, 2016, 6:59 PM
George Hughes
How're you? I'm more free to chat now btw, Kaitlin has left and I'm not doing much
Jul 12, 2016, 6:58 PM

Callum Davies
Alright then, I'll leave you to it. Enjoy 🎸
Jul 12, 2016, 1:27 PM
George Hughes
That's what I'm about to try and do just now 
Jul 12, 2016, 1:27 PM
Callum Davies
But did you get a good recording in the end?
Jul 12, 2016, 1:27 PM
George Hughes
Yeah it is pretty amusing 🙄
Jul 12, 2016, 1:25 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, bugger! But just a little bit funny, you have to admit
Jul 12, 2016, 1:23 PM
George Hughes
I'm annoyed I went to record my mandolin solo, did 10 takes and turns out o was recording the wrong input 
Jul 12, 2016, 1:22 PM
George Hughes
Sounds awesome!
Jul 12, 2016, 1:22 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, Kyle says it's fine for you to join us tomorrow at the pub. We'll be there around 7:30, see you there, hopefully. I'll text you when we're there tomorrow.
Jul 12, 2016, 1:19 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then, see you soon
Jul 11, 2016, 7:50 PM
George Hughes
Alright I'll be there in 10, I'll call you when I'm nearly there
Jul 11, 2016, 7:50 PM
Callum Davies
Or Village Inn, doesn't much matter. They're both on the same street
Jul 11, 2016, 7:50 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I'm away to leave the house now, last cast right?
Jul 11, 2016, 7:49 PM

George Hughes
True dat 😐 sounds good, I gotta go now, chat later 
Jun 28, 2016, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies
It was good. I only had a couple, becuase I know when to stop, unlike this guy! ☝🏻 Ha ha, but I couldn't have that much anyway because I had work the next day. But it was fun.
Jun 28, 2016, 6:06 PM
George Hughes
If only  but nice, how was it?
Jun 28, 2016, 6:05 PM
Callum Davies
I was down the pub yesterday though.
Jun 28, 2016, 6:04 PM
Callum Davies
By the way, I was just wondering if you wanted to maybe meet up with me, Beth and Kyle at the pub, wait, ahhh! 😁😂
Jun 28, 2016, 6:03 PM
Callum Davies
No...is that happening? I've got a camp
Jun 28, 2016, 6:02 PM
George Hughes
Ahh right, talking of Friday, squad meetup this fri? 
Jun 28, 2016, 6:02 PM
Callum Davies
2 a week. But I have to work 8 days straight just now because I'm taking a 10-day holiday starting Friday.
Jun 28, 2016, 6:01 PM
George Hughes
Ahh I guess, don't tire yourself out too much tho  what days do you get off?
Jun 28, 2016, 6:00 PM
Callum Davies
More money that way. I've got to earn as much as I can in my gap year, to make sure I have plenty for university.
Jun 28, 2016, 6:00 PM
George Hughes
Fair enough lol, jeez that must be exhausting, what made you want to work full time?
Jun 28, 2016, 5:59 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, couldn't care less to be honest. I've just come home from my 6th straight day of working full-time. 😓
Jun 28, 2016, 5:58 PM

Hey, some intersesting shizzle going on in the chat lmao

Sounds good, if there's no particular time you need to go home, just stay out til 6ish
Jun 11, 2016, 7:12 PM
Callum Davies
I'm assuming you mean 2, and okay. I've got a driving lesson that comes into town at 11:30. So how about I just stay in town. I'll browse for hours! 😛
Jun 11, 2016, 7:10 PM
George Hughes
Just whenever, 14ish again?
Jun 11, 2016, 7:09 PM
Callum Davies
What time?
Jun 11, 2016, 7:08 PM
George Hughes
Want to meet up with the squad on Wednesday in town?
Jun 11, 2016, 7:07 PM
George Hughes
Aye very true, even i found it loud XD
Jun 11, 2016, 1:42 PM
Callum Davies
Yuh, perhaps wasn't the best choice of venue though; bit loud! :P
Jun 11, 2016, 1:41 PM
George Hughes
Ahh nice nice, did you two enjoy yourself tho? :P
Jun 11, 2016, 1:40 PM
Callum Davies
Yuh, fine. Just busy is all ;)

Jun 7, 2016, 11:59 PM
George Hughes
I'm actually gonna head to sleep now, I'm getting up early for the gym, night man 😎
Jun 7, 2016, 11:59 PM
George Hughes
Okay?
Jun 7, 2016, 11:57 PM
Callum Davies
Ohhh! Wait a second
Jun 7, 2016, 11:57 PM
George Hughes
Ahaha I don't get it 😆
Jun 7, 2016, 11:57 PM
Callum Davies
And suit up! Joking 😉 Just thought I'd slip in a How I Met Your Mother reference in there.
Jun 7, 2016, 11:55 PM
George Hughes
Aye for sure 😉
Jun 7, 2016, 11:54 PM
Callum Davies
So, I might need a wingman on Friday, do you reckon you're up for it when you're not on stage? 😉
Jun 7, 2016, 11:54 PM
George Hughes
Ahh sounds good
Jun 7, 2016, 11:53 PM
Callum Davies
That's why
Jun 7, 2016, 11:52 PM
Callum Davies
She's taking psychology at college this year
Jun 7, 2016, 11:52 PM
George Hughes
Ohh my ahaha
Jun 7, 2016, 11:51 PM
Callum Davies
The psychologist. He theorised psychosexual development
Jun 7, 2016, 11:51 PM
George Hughes
What's that?
Jun 7, 2016, 11:51 PM
Callum Davies
I know. We've just had a chat about Freud
Jun 7, 2016, 11:50 PM
George Hughes
Ahh fair enough, keep your head high tho 😝
Jun 7, 2016, 11:50 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not sure if I've asked her out. I'm taking it slow. I've just asked her to the gig. Not sure if she thinks it's a date or not. So don't speak too soon, is all.
Jun 7, 2016, 11:49 PM
George Hughes
Aww cute lucky Laura
Jun 7, 2016, 11:48 PM
Callum Davies
I'll be needing that ticket after all. I'll pay you on Thursday
Jun 7, 2016, 11:31 PM
George Hughes
Ahaha fair enough
Jun 7, 2016, 11:18 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, what can I say? It's been a while.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:42 PM
George Hughes
Ooh cheeky
Jun 7, 2016, 10:41 PM
Callum Davies
nudge,nudge, wink,wink
Jun 7, 2016, 10:40 PM
Callum Davies
Yes she does. Just a short skip and a hop from each other's houses ;)
Jun 7, 2016, 10:39 PM
George Hughes
Yeah sure thing, I don't think we're gonna sell out anyways 😝 but that's cute, she lives in Abernathy as well doesn't she?
Jun 7, 2016, 10:39 PM
Callum Davies
If worst comes to worst, could you maybe reserve a ticket on the night, and I'll pay you then. Just in case she only replies very late.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:38 PM
Callum Davies
She was always VERY friendly in the school corridors. And once, at the pub, she drunkenly said that she liked me. So, it may have just been beer goggles, or alcohol expressing her inner thoughts. Either way, I'd really quite like to know. So, here goes. I'm inviting her to your gig thing.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:37 PM
George Hughes
What're the signs you've been seeing?
Jun 7, 2016, 10:36 PM
George Hughes
Aww that's cute 😝
Jun 7, 2016, 10:35 PM
Callum Davies
I think she's liked me for quite a few years! ;)
Jun 7, 2016, 10:32 PM
George Hughes
Aye I do, how long have you liked her? 😆
Jun 7, 2016, 10:32 PM
Callum Davies
I'm assuming you get the gist of why I'm asking this?
Jun 7, 2016, 10:31 PM
George Hughes
Awesome 😎
Jun 7, 2016, 10:31 PM
Callum Davies
So I'll need to buy a ticket on Thursday then, maybe. I'll let you know.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:28 PM
Callum Davies
I will.
Jun 7, 2016, 10:28 PM
George Hughes
I doubt it, but you should ask her if she wants to? 😉
Jun 7, 2016, 10:28 PM
Callum Davies
Just one, maybe. You happen to know if Laura Ferguson is going, do you? You can probably guess the reason ;)
Jun 7, 2016, 10:27 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I've got a few spares, how many you wanting? 😝
Jun 7, 2016, 10:26 PM
Callum Davies
Are there any tickets left for the gig this Friday?
Jun 7, 2016, 10:24 PM
George Hughes
Nice nice
Jun 6, 2016, 3:38 PM
Callum Davies
Just asking Lauren now. This is the actual post to the group : "Hi Everyone,

We are putting out a press release for the Youth Arts festival. Are any of you available this Thursday at 4pm to come to PCH and get your picture taken for the papers?

Let me know.

Thanks"
Jun 6, 2016, 3:37 PM
George Hughes
That sounds fine to me, any idea how long?
Jun 6, 2016, 3:36 PM
Callum Davies
Hey George, it may be that on Thursday at 4:00, I have to get my picture taken at the concert hall for pyt. If i go there, I doubt it'll take too long, so how about we go our seperate ways at 4:00, then after the picture i'll call you to meet up again in town until i have to go to pyt at 6:30? how does that sound?
Jun 6, 2016, 3:35 PM
George Hughes
Exactly, and same 😎
Jun 6, 2016, 9:50 AM
Callum Davies
Cheers. The human person needs companionship! I'm looking forward to it 😁
Jun 6, 2016, 9:47 AM
George Hughes
Aye that's what study leave does to you 😆 we just need to keep meeting up, Toma got really down when he didn't meet anyone for months. And yeah there's plenty of time 😝
Jun 6, 2016, 9:46 AM
Callum Davies
Could we maybe also stop off at the bank? I need to deposit some money 😀
Jun 6, 2016, 9:43 AM
Callum Davies
Cheers. Oh, and I'm not sure if I'll actually eat at KFC (I don't usually eat lunch). But I'll be more than happy for the company! 😁 In honesty, I've been feeling a little down, as of late, and I think I'm feeling a little lonely. A day out with friends ought to fix that right up! 😁
Jun 6, 2016, 9:41 AM
George Hughes
Aye we've got a few hours, may as well wander round the shops
Jun 6, 2016, 9:39 AM
Callum Davies
Anyway. Do you think while we're out, we might be able to stop off at CeX and GAME? There's a game I'm looking for
Jun 6, 2016, 9:38 AM
George Hughes
Oh wait, I'm on iOS so the emojis are probably different, it comes up as a pair of skis for me 😂
Jun 6, 2016, 9:37 AM
Callum Davies
Oh. I thought it was a guy skiing. I didn't look at it properly! 😂
Jun 6, 2016, 9:37 AM
George Hughes
I don't think those skis are wearing socks
Jun 6, 2016, 9:36 AM
George Hughes
That's a pair of skiis 😂😂😂
Jun 6, 2016, 9:36 AM
Callum Davies
Awesome socks 🎿 That bloke is probably wearing socks 😛
Jun 6, 2016, 9:35 AM
George Hughes
We could get on the same bus actually
Jun 6, 2016, 9:34 AM
George Hughes
Awesaam, and yeah defo, it does depend what bus I can get in
Jun 6, 2016, 9:34 AM
Callum Davies
Is it possible for you and Sunil to wait until about 2:20-25?
Jun 6, 2016, 9:34 AM
Callum Davies
Kk. I'll see what bus I can get in
Jun 6, 2016, 9:33 AM
George Hughes
I can't find any beans tho
Jun 6, 2016, 9:32 AM

Jun 6, 2016, 9:32 AM
George Hughes
And yeah that's the one
Jun 6, 2016, 9:31 AM
George Hughes
Aye we can stay out til then
Jun 6, 2016, 9:31 AM
Callum Davies
Okay, but I'll need to walk up to the big Tesco by town for 6:15-20. Do you think we'll be out that long? Else it seems kind of pointless me going back only to come straight back in. And do you mean the ring with the statue of the old man and the boy?
Jun 6, 2016, 9:30 AM
George Hughes
Well I'm going into town to go to kfc with Sunil, I was wondering if you wanted to join us? It'd be 2:00 that we're meeting, probs by the ring area in town
Jun 6, 2016, 9:19 AM
Callum Davies
Well, I have youth theatre at 6:30pm. So I'll maybe need to take a bus into Bridge of Earn, carry my PYT bag around with me, then take the 18:00 bus from bridge of earn main street into town. Why do you ask?
Jun 6, 2016, 8:13 AM
George Hughes
Hey, are you free on Thursday?

George Hughes
You should be near a house tho?

Relationships can be hard, but if you find the right person, you'll want to make the effort
Nov 15, 2015, 2:51 PM
Callum Davies
I guess if I find the right person, I'll want to hold on to her. But in the meantime I'll have a great time being single!
Nov 15, 2015, 2:50 PM
George Hughes
I tend to avoid relationships most of the time
Nov 15, 2015, 2:50 PM
Callum Davies
But I'll be honest, one night stands can be very fun 😉
Nov 15, 2015, 2:49 PM
George Hughes
I'll find the right person when I do, my passion lies elsewhere
Nov 15, 2015, 2:49 PM

I'll be honest George, I didn't think you were that shallow. Don't you ever feel the desire to find someone you can know and love, not just have sex with?
Nov 15, 2015, 2:48 PM
Callum Davies
One night stands are fine, if you're into that. But I'd just feel hollow and soulless. I want to get to know someone on a personal level. And for that, I find an actual personality is needed.
Nov 15, 2015, 2:47 PM
George Hughes
Ah okay lol who says I'm after relationships, one night stands are fine if the girl is unintelligent XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:45 PM
Callum Davies
That's what ended my relationship with Emma. I could not get a decent conversation out of her
Nov 15, 2015, 2:43 PM
George Hughes
Most girls are after a guy who has power, most hot girls anyway, aye I'm that shallow XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:43 PM
Callum Davies
Yes, but the interesting and intelligent guy gets the QUALITY girl, with whom he can participate in interesting conversation
Nov 15, 2015, 2:42 PM
George Hughes
And*
Nov 15, 2015, 2:40 PM
George Hughes
Aye plus the popular guy gets the girls an attention, people like attention ahaha XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:40 PM
Callum Davies
I mean, I've been trying to be more social and meet new people lately, so I completely get where you're coming from
Nov 15, 2015, 2:39 PM
Callum Davies
I am by no means saying that one should not strive to befriend new companions - humans are social animals - I am merely saying you need people who are close to you also. Which is what you just said lol 😝
Nov 15, 2015, 2:38 PM
George Hughes
I like having those few people but I also like my following, even if I don't know them very well
Nov 15, 2015, 2:36 PM
Callum Davies
Ah, the concept of popularity is a somewhat shallow pursuit, wouldn't you say. I'd rather have a few people with whom I feel I can reside in than a group of people I barely know. Quality over quantity.
Nov 15, 2015, 2:36 PM
George Hughes
Aye kinda 😂 not in terms of popular tho XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:32 PM
Callum Davies
Nerd is the new cool! You can be both, you know.
Nov 15, 2015, 2:23 PM
George Hughes
Ahaha I'm becoming cool, soon I will no longer be a nerd 😏😂
Nov 15, 2015, 2:23 PM
Callum Davies
Nice! Get booked, get paid, get the ladies! 😉 And that's fine. The student has become the master. So proud 😂
Nov 15, 2015, 2:21 PM
George Hughes
Soz about slow relies btw got a few girls going on SC XD
Nov 15, 2015, 2:19 PM
George Hughes
Not tonight, but got like 10 over the next month 😄😎
Nov 15, 2015, 2:19 PM
Callum Davies
I was hoping for a chat! You got any gigs tonight?
Nov 15, 2015, 2:16 PM
George Hughes
Lol listen to some music 😆
Nov 15, 2015, 2:15 PM

I'm bored 😒

Callum Davies
Not bad, just been doing the odd bit of work and relaxing
Oct 15, 2015, 4:41 PM
George Hughes
It was only practising and an open mic, the gig is tomorrow, but it was good anyhow. How has your holiday been so far?
Oct 15, 2015, 11:49 AM
Callum Davies
Good, good thanks. So how was the gigging yesterday?
Oct 15, 2015, 11:38 AM

Sorry, my mistake. It's Tony with a y. I thought it was Toni with an i. I've only just got up, don't judge me! 😭
Sep 11, 2015, 8:36 AM
Callum Davies
Yes, I do. Still a cheap shot. And that would imply that you fucked her, in order for you to be able to unfuck her. Did you? Lol 😝
Sep 11, 2015, 8:34 AM
George Hughes
See it?
Sep 10, 2015, 9:48 PM
George Hughes
Well, I mean look closely at the comment XD

Aug 16, 2015, 3:18 PM
Callum Davies
Well, it's what most of the student loans are spent on anyway! Got to go now. See you later
Aug 16, 2015, 3:17 PM
George Hughes
Yeah they do, it's at 3% at the moment
Aug 16, 2015, 3:16 PM
George Hughes
Haha never heard that before XD
Aug 16, 2015, 3:16 PM
Callum Davies
I'm not sure
Aug 16, 2015, 3:15 PM
Callum Davies
Student loan, or as they're more commonly called, Beer Budget! :-P
Aug 16, 2015, 3:15 PM
George Hughes
Is there interest on it? I don't think there is
Aug 16, 2015, 3:15 PM
George Hughes
True, but it's not heavily enforced, you can pay it back over a long period of time
Aug 16, 2015, 3:15 PM
Callum Davies
You still have to pay it back though. It's not free money :-(
Aug 16, 2015, 3:14 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, yea. 😄
Aug 16, 2015, 3:13 PM
George Hughes
Sorry, I meant student loan XD not a grant
Aug 16, 2015, 3:13 PM
Callum Davies
Yea, but do you know how hard it is to get a government grant? Chances are that you'll have to take a student loan.
Aug 16, 2015, 3:12 PM
George Hughes
Or simple should I say
Aug 16, 2015, 3:12 PM
George Hughes
Haha yeah, it's also very confusing to get around XD
Aug 16, 2015, 3:12 PM
George Hughes
I've looked up the website and as far as I can tell, the government pay for everything for the uni and then you use your grant to buy books etc
Aug 16, 2015, 3:11 PM
Callum Davies
But I should talk. I'm wanting to go to Edinburgh, which is famous for being cheap to live in(!)
Aug 16, 2015, 3:11 PM
Callum Davies
Books, the fees that the actual unis charge themselves that aren't tuition related, and loads more. It's very expensive
Aug 16, 2015, 3:10 PM
George Hughes
Only living, as far as I know
Aug 16, 2015, 3:09 PM
Callum Davies
You still have other costs aside from tuition fees...
Aug 16, 2015, 3:09 PM
George Hughes
No it shouldn't do, free education in Scotland and stuff XD
Aug 16, 2015, 3:08 PM
Callum Davies
It's a good uni, but expensive
Aug 16, 2015, 3:08 PM
Callum Davies
Anyway, St Andrews is going to cost a pretty penny if you do apply.
Aug 16, 2015, 3:08 PM
George Hughes
Sweet, napier looks good for performing arts
Aug 16, 2015, 3:08 PM
Callum Davies
I know. My first choice is a degree in Acting and English at the Edinburgh Napier University.
Aug 16, 2015, 3:07 PM
George Hughes
Not entirely sure, but Abertay, Stirling and St Andrews are my main ones, what ones are you going to apply for? I hear Edinburgh have good acting universities btw
Aug 16, 2015, 3:06 PM
Callum Davies
Cool. Do you have an idea of which uni(s) you're going to apply to yet?
Aug 16, 2015, 3:05 PM
George Hughes
Haha if anywhere, uni XD
Aug 16, 2015, 3:04 PM
Callum Davies
Cool, sounds like you're going places! 😄
Aug 16, 2015, 3:04 PM
George Hughes
Haha I wish, still stuck at 3 figures ugh XD
It's going good though, got a busking amp for busy days 😄
Aug 16, 2015, 3:03 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, thanks. How's the busking going by the way? Are the profits in 4 figures yet? :-P
Aug 16, 2015, 3:02 PM
George Hughes
That's true, well there's no reason you shouldn't get one in that case 😃
Aug 16, 2015, 3:00 PM
Callum Davies
Hopefully I get called in for an interview😄
Aug 16, 2015, 3:00 PM
Callum Davies
Basically a bit of drama experience elsewhere, ie at school, ability to either play piano or guitar, and good nat 5 and higher grades in drama. All of which I have 😄
Aug 16, 2015, 2:59 PM
George Hughes
What do you need for directing at horsecross then?
Aug 16, 2015, 2:57 PM
George Hughes
Haha sounds busy and fun 😄 I can't wait to learn to drive!
Aug 16, 2015, 2:57 PM
Callum Davies
Not much, applying for a directing job at Horsecross, looking towards uni, holiday homework, learning to drive. The normal stuff 😜
Aug 16, 2015, 2:56 PM
George Hughes
Lots and lots of music haha, what about you?
Aug 16, 2015, 2:55 PM

No prob, see you at school, and just to say, the answers to the questions that I did out of the booklet may or may not be correct, so I wouldn't take them as gospel! :-P the examples did with the teacher are right though :-)

Jun 4, 2015, 11:04 AM
Callum Davies
As I say, that's my guess. I'd have to cross reference every person that falls under Ross C on the pupil register to know for sure. I'll do it with the email address book at the library. I'll let you know then
Jun 4, 2015, 11:04 AM
George Hughes
really, Ross Crawford reverted it back
Jun 4, 2015, 11:02 AM
Callum Davies
The name of the Instagram account under that name is Ross C. My best guess it it's Ross Crawford! Got him!
Jun 4, 2015, 11:02 AM
George Hughes
Let me know who it is once you know
Jun 4, 2015, 11:01 AM
George Hughes

Jun 4, 2015, 11:00 AM
Callum Davies
Found his twitter account, I've got him! Give me a min, and I'll find out his identity. He must have left a trace somewhere
Jun 4, 2015, 11:00 AM
George Hughes
The name sounds like a pupil
Jun 4, 2015, 11:00 AM
George Hughes
Haha cool
Jun 4, 2015, 10:59 AM
Callum Davies
I know, says he's Scottish, so could be a pupil, or teacher, I'm investigating further as I speak
Jun 4, 2015, 10:59 AM
George Hughes
No wasn't me haha
Jun 4, 2015, 10:58 AM
Callum Davies
Just had a little investigate, the page was edited by some bloke called NewTestLeper79
Jun 4, 2015, 10:57 AM
Callum Davies
The Perth high school Wikipedia page has been changed, with our additions, and the stuff about Mr. Flood gone. Wouldn't have anything to do with you would it. It says it was modified yesterday at quarter past one.
Jun 4, 2015, 10:55 AM
George Hughes
Okay doke, see you tomorrow
Jun 2, 2015, 6:39 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then, Mum's calling me to tea now, so see you tomorrow
Jun 2, 2015, 6:39 PM
George Hughes
Ahhh Yeah I had 25 instead of 35 for some reason
Jun 2, 2015, 6:38 PM
Callum Davies
5C = 35
Jun 2, 2015, 6:38 PM
George Hughes
Oh
Jun 2, 2015, 6:37 PM
Callum Davies
I got C as 7
Jun 2, 2015, 6:37 PM
George Hughes
Oh, so A is -3 and c is 5 right
Jun 2, 2015, 6:37 PM
Callum Davies
Ergo B = -14
Jun 2, 2015, 6:36 PM
Callum Davies
I got 3B = -42
Jun 2, 2015, 6:36 PM
Callum Davies
Let me check
Jun 2, 2015, 6:35 PM
George Hughes
No thanks, but I will ask, did you get 12B = 42 for 2d cause that threw me
Jun 2, 2015, 6:35 PM
Callum Davies
Do you want me to send you my answers?
Jun 2, 2015, 6:34 PM
George Hughes
Oh right
Jun 2, 2015, 6:33 PM
Callum Davies
Ahh, okay, I did up to 3d
Jun 2, 2015, 6:33 PM
George Hughes
Oh, I haven't done that yet, but I got a strange number for 2d so that's where I stopped
Jun 2, 2015, 6:32 PM
Callum Davies
Question 3d, for the maths
Jun 2, 2015, 6:31 PM
George Hughes
Yeah let's do that, and what's a q 3d?
Jun 2, 2015, 6:30 PM
Callum Davies
I have mine 1,2,5,6 so do you want to study together 5 & 6. Also, did you do q 3d?
Jun 2, 2015, 6:30 PM
George Hughes
Are those when any of your are
Jun 2, 2015, 6:29 PM
George Hughes
Period 3, 5 and 6

Well, when it comes to their cows, they do make a lot of cuts! Proper joke!
May 25, 2015, 5:45 PM
George Hughes
I know, I blame McDonald's and their twisted policies, which are somewhat similar to that of the Conservatives
May 25, 2015, 5:44 PM

May 25, 2015, 5:43 PM
Callum Davies
But only if it's British beef. Bloody foreign cows, coming over here, forcing themselves into our burgers!
May 25, 2015, 5:43 PM

I want Ukip burgers
May 25, 2015, 5:41 PM

May 25, 2015, 5:41 PM
Callum Davies
Well, Ali's just made a very good point
May 25, 2015, 5:40 PM
George Hughes
Yeah I've just seen your very complex conversation
May 25, 2015, 5:39 PM
Callum Davies
Just a minute, I'm just gunna read Ali's post on your post.
May 25, 2015, 5:38 PM

Now it's stored in my dictionary
May 25, 2015, 5:36 PM

Haha Icelandic curse! I see where you're coming from, up north apparently
May 25, 2015, 5:36 PM
Callum Davies
Yeah, chemistry lol. How does "Thankfully" translate into what looks like an Icelandic curse lol
May 25, 2015, 5:35 PM
George Hughes
Predictive couldn't even fix that one XD
May 25, 2015, 5:35 PM
George Hughes

May 25, 2015, 5:34 PM

Yeah rhabsjfukk, you've only got one to go now?
May 25, 2015, 5:34 PM
Callum Davies
Have you done all your exams now?
May 25, 2015, 5:33 PM
George Hughes
I probably would, yeah
May 25, 2015, 5:32 PM
George Hughes
Plus I don't play games apart from 2048 and minecraft nowadays
May 25, 2015, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
Fair enough, but I do think you'd like it, very puzzle-orientated
May 25, 2015, 5:32 PM
George Hughes
Meh I'm not mad on xbox
May 25, 2015, 5:31 PM
Callum Davies
Pretty sure it's on the 360
May 25, 2015, 5:31 PM
George Hughes
XD
May 25, 2015, 5:31 PM
George Hughes
I would have enjoyed a 2D game cube version
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
It is great
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
It looks good though
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
Hmm sounds intriguing however I'll probably never play it
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
If you ever do play Portal 2, I'll just say that the final level escalates very quickly 
May 25, 2015, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
Portal 2 will have so much more support cause companies will have seen its potential and invested
May 25, 2015, 5:29 PM
Callum Davies
Such different games in length. Took me about a year to complete Portal 2, took me an afternoon to complete the first one!
May 25, 2015, 5:28 PM
George Hughes
But yeah I felt a bit worried but there's no use in getting upset when you can't do anything now
May 25, 2015, 5:28 PM
George Hughes
Hoho
May 25, 2015, 5:28 PM
Callum Davies
I wasn't quite in tears about it, I was literally just a bit worried for a bit and then felt better after I heard what other people had to say about it and then went home and ate some cake...which was a lie! #portalreference
May 25, 2015, 5:27 PM
George Hughes
Yeah exactly, when I heard there had been tears over it I felt much better
May 25, 2015, 5:26 PM
Callum Davies
Well I actually felt a lot better when other people said that they found it really hard also, made me feel less stupid!
May 25, 2015, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
That'll be why there's such a huge deal being made
May 25, 2015, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
Haha I haven't heard that, sheesh it's getting a bit out of hand, all of us felt bad coming out the exam but when we went to bed, it would have felt a he'll of a lot worse than it actually was, you know
May 25, 2015, 5:24 PM
Callum Davies
The SQA have even had to release a press statement on their website telling concerned parents to CALM THE FUCK DOWN!!! ...Although perhaps not in those EXACT words 
May 25, 2015, 5:22 PM
George Hughes
Not in a sadistic way of course xD
May 25, 2015, 5:21 PM
George Hughes
And I was so relieved that people were crying about it cause I didn't feel that bad
May 25, 2015, 5:20 PM
George Hughes
But yeah I read the article in the Scotsman the day after
May 25, 2015, 5:20 PM
George Hughes
That's exactly what I said to my family, it's another nat 5 English XD
May 25, 2015, 5:20 PM
Callum Davies
Have you the news story about it? It's like the N5 English "benign neglect" question all over again!
May 25, 2015, 5:19 PM
George Hughes
It was a horrible exam though, hope we've done alright
May 25, 2015, 5:18 PM
Callum Davies
Perfectly alright :-)
May 25, 2015, 5:18 PM
George Hughes
Yeah that's what I got, but my grandad got a different answer when he tried it, thanks for confirming my answer 
May 25, 2015, 5:17 PM
Callum Davies
Yuh, I can't exactly remember which way round it was, but one was 52ft and the other was 48ft, so doesn't make it
May 25, 2015, 5:16 PM
George Hughes
Ah right, you've still got chemistry, well hopefully the revision goes well. I was gonna ask you as well for the frog and toad question in maths, did you get that one of them never makes it up
May 25, 2015, 5:15 PM
Callum Davies
Just wondering, I'm in for a chemistry revision class is all
May 25, 2015, 5:13 PM
George Hughes
Sweet haha, and nah I won't be, why?
May 25, 2015, 5:13 PM
Callum Davies
Don't worry, I will keep it up, I just give credit where it's due. BTW are you in school tomorrow?
May 25, 2015, 5:11 PM
George Hughes
Haha thanks, make sure you keep up your satire though, mine only appears once every decade  no competition here
May 25, 2015, 5:10 PM
Callum Davies
Not bad, it seems I have some competition in the field of political satire lol. You, my friend, truly have your finger on the pulse of current affairs. A doff of the satirist's cap to you sir, kudos, very funny 
May 25, 2015, 5:07 PM
George Hughes
Hey, how's you?
May 25, 2015, 5:05 PM
Callum Davies
Hey, wassup?
May 25, 2015, 5:05 PM
George Hughes
See you later then
May 7, 2015, 12:09 PM
Callum Davies
Alright then, that seems good for me, see you then.
May 7, 2015, 12:08 PM
George Hughes
Well, we could do it in the evening at some point, and yeah feel free to record it. Between 6 and 8 maybe, I'll need to check when's good
May 7, 2015, 12:01 PM
Callum Davies
I'm up for intelligent debate. Voltaire once said "I do not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it". Well with me it's more like, " I do not agree with what you say, but I will still respect your right to hold them, for they are your own, just as mine are mine own". When do want to do it, and would you mind if I filmed it as an election special for my channel?
May 7, 2015, 11:51 AM
George Hughes
Yeah I'm still up, looking forward to the potential interesting and intelligent debate we may possibly have depending on if our views conflict 
May 7, 2015, 11:27 AM
Callum Davies
Are you still up for skyping tonight. It's election day! 
May 7, 2015, 10:08 AM
George Hughes
Thanks, see you!
May 5, 2015, 10:46 AM
Callum Davies
Thanks, good luck to you for tomorrow as well, see you later 
May 5, 2015, 10:46 AM
George Hughes
I could very well have XD Okay doke, good idea, talk to you later and good luck again
May 5, 2015, 10:45 AM
Callum Davies
Cool, or you could have just googled it! I'm going to have to go now, gonna take a walk into town, just to clear my head before the exam
May 5, 2015, 10:44 AM
George Hughes
Ahhh sense makes more now, I admit I only came across it because of Colin Meloy a few weeks ago anyway
May 5, 2015, 10:43 AM
Callum Davies
Sorry, meant to say did NOT know that 
May 5, 2015, 10:42 AM
George Hughes
Sure you did 
May 5, 2015, 10:42 AM
George Hughes
Funnily enough, the BBC describes Colin Meloy as being erudite
May 5, 2015, 10:42 AM
Callum Davies
Ahh, did know that
May 5, 2015, 10:41 AM
George Hughes
Newton I beg your pardon
May 5, 2015, 10:41 AM
George Hughes
Nope, it's a very rare synonym for greatly intelligent and intrigued about how things work, basically just a word to describe Albert Einstein or Isaac Newcastle
May 5, 2015, 10:41 AM
Callum Davies
It's a made-up sci-fi word isn't it?
May 5, 2015, 10:39 AM
George Hughes
If you can 
May 5, 2015, 10:38 AM
George Hughes
Well you're pretty close with that, but what really got me were the names of the factions; erudite for example, define that?
May 5, 2015, 10:38 AM
Callum Davies
Teenage girls seem to like that sort of stuff, so the author just thought "I'll write exactly the same thing, but change it slightly so nobody will notice, and make loads of money!!!" 
May 5, 2015, 10:37 AM
George Hughes
I've googled it and yeah, hunger games came first. I like to use the word inspired rather than copy of course 
May 5, 2015, 10:35 AM
Callum Davies
The book was a copy of the hunger games! 
May 5, 2015, 10:34 AM
George Hughes
Hahaha nah it's based on a book that I'm sure was written before hunger games
May 5, 2015, 10:34 AM
Callum Davies
Nah, it was just a shameless copy of the hunger games
May 5, 2015, 10:34 AM
George Hughes
Really, you didn't like it?
May 5, 2015, 10:33 AM
Callum Davies
I've seen it, it's just the hunger games, but worse
May 5, 2015, 10:33 AM
George Hughes
Sort of like hunger games but seemingly more relaxed
May 5, 2015, 10:33 AM
George Hughes
It's called divergent and it's a sort of dystopia Sci Fi romance thingy, it was very good but there was a little too much romance for a Sci Fi film
May 5, 2015, 10:32 AM
Callum Davies
What was the film you were watching yesterday?
May 5, 2015, 10:32 AM
George Hughes
Noooooo!
May 5, 2015, 10:31 AM
Callum Davies
There's a glitch in the Matrix!
May 5, 2015, 10:31 AM
George Hughes
Yeah, I do that a lot as well
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
George Hughes
Looks like you're good to go
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
Callum Davies
Maybe i misheard, I tend to do that... A lot 
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
George Hughes
01000001 01101000 01101000 01101000 01101000 01101000
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
George Hughes
Say ahhhh
May 5, 2015, 10:30 AM
George Hughes
Computing, but maybe I did, and if I did, then I need to see a doctor to confirm my brain is functioning adequately for said exam
May 5, 2015, 10:29 AM
Callum Davies
Didn't you say you had a history exam tomorrow?
May 5, 2015, 10:28 AM
George Hughes
Probably why*
May 5, 2015, 10:28 AM
George Hughes
Probably, I don't know much history  probably I didn't do too good last year in nat 5
May 5, 2015, 10:28 AM
Callum Davies
There isn't a sixth reich, the Third Reich was disbanded after WWII wasn't it?
May 5, 2015, 10:27 AM
George Hughes
Not that I brutally murdered all the staff in the history department
May 5, 2015, 10:26 AM
George Hughes
And my history class is in the past, because it is no longer present
May 5, 2015, 10:26 AM
George Hughes
And I'll have you know it was the Rise of the Sixth Reich or Something
May 5, 2015, 10:25 AM
Callum Davies
How does that work? The past is always history unless it somehow moves to the future...
May 5, 2015, 10:25 AM
George Hughes
It was but no longer is 
May 5, 2015, 10:24 AM
George Hughes
Ahh but you see my friend, my history class is history...
May 5, 2015, 10:24 AM
Callum Davies
But that's the future, and then the recent past. Should you not be revising the rise of the Third Reich or something 
May 5, 2015, 10:23 AM
George Hughes
Brits *
May 5, 2015, 10:23 AM
George Hughes
XD
May 5, 2015, 10:22 AM
George Hughes
History hmm? I'm focusing mainly on this Thursday, which I believe is a very important day;the general election in which the big parties go down. It was a big day for the bits
May 5, 2015, 10:22 AM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, fair enough. What part of history are you revising?
May 5, 2015, 10:21 AM
George Hughes
I don't mind, I can revise and chat simultaneously considering our conversations are usually fairly educated
May 5, 2015, 10:20 AM
Callum Davies
Yea, alright. I'll leave you to revise if you want...
May 5, 2015, 10:19 AM
George Hughes
Damn, I can chat here for a while if you're bored?
May 5, 2015, 10:19 AM
Callum Davies
12:45, never mind, I'm just bored! 
May 5, 2015, 10:18 AM
George Hughes
Nah sorry, when's your exam?
May 5, 2015, 10:18 AM
Callum Davies
Are you in school today?
May 5, 2015, 10:17 AM
George Hughes

Callum Davies
Yuh sure, can you just drop me text when you're ready, I turn my WiFi off when I'm not using it to save battery.
May 4, 2015, 6:08 PM
George Hughes
I can't go on Skype just now, but maybe in an hour or so once mum's back and we've had tea
May 4, 2015, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies

May 4, 2015, 6:07 PM
Callum Davies
Yea sure, wanna arrange it on Skype just now?
May 4, 2015, 6:07 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, if you've got an idea of music for all of them, or if they're spoofs, then yeah and I can autotune your voice as well  want to meet up some time before the maths exam?
May 4, 2015, 6:04 PM
Callum Davies
We should arrange to meet up for revision sometime over study leave
May 4, 2015, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
You may be aware that I have now written three comedy songs, and if I can put a tune to it, a fourth. We should maybe get together and record them for my channel! 
May 4, 2015, 5:23 PM
Callum Davies
Ha ha, thanks
May 4, 2015, 4:56 PM
George Hughes
That's really cool! I like it, well done! I don't give a... XD
May 4, 2015, 12:37 PM
Callum Davies
Wrote a new comedy song, could you tell me what you think? Thanks :)

Well, is there anything you absolutely need to do, nobody else will be there, trust me. I just went into drama, and the teacher asked why we there. None of the teachers are expecting people to come.
Apr 30, 2015, 12:42 PM
George Hughes
Haha, maybe, I've got music then though
Apr 30, 2015, 12:40 PM

Jan 5, 2015, 11:03 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, will do, send a link tomorrow and I'll take a listen
Jan 5, 2015, 11:03 PM
Callum Davies

Jan 5, 2015, 11:03 PM
George Hughes
I don't, but I can easily learn it, the chords look easy
Jan 5, 2015, 11:02 PM
Callum Davies
exactly, i just need a taste pf what it'll sound like with the gutiar, may i ask if you know the song already
Jan 5, 2015, 11:02 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, it doesn't need to be perfect. And haha woohoo
Jan 5, 2015, 11:01 PM
Callum Davies

George Hughes
Haha cool, gotta go, I might be back in a bit
Jan 5, 2015, 9:12 PM
Callum Davies
ha ha, well that's the full song, i've told you the last line
Jan 5, 2015, 9:12 PM
George Hughes
That's what it did haha
Jan 5, 2015, 9:11 PM
George Hughes

Jan 5, 2015, 9:11 PM
Callum Davies
that's the line, but the C is at "need"
Jan 5, 2015, 9:11 PM
Callum Davies
C
Then you need to fight it!
Jan 5, 2015, 9:11 PM
George Hughes
Haha my computer did last time, now it's my ipad that's doing it
Jan 5, 2015, 9:10 PM
Callum Davies
your computer is cutting the last line off all of my documents
Jan 5, 2015, 9:10 PM
George Hughes
Oh right, the version you sent me missed out that last bit haha
Jan 5, 2015, 9:09 PM
Callum Davies
the line is cuz if you do like it/ then you need to fight it"
Jan 5, 2015, 9:09 PM
Callum Davies
but it is, wait a minute
Jan 5, 2015, 9:08 PM
George Hughes
Haha good idea, but I think if you're saying cause, then you need to finish the sentence 
Jan 5, 2015, 9:08 PM
Callum Davies
yea maybe, that's acually a line from the song, i thought it would be clever to samople at least one, see who noticed
Jan 5, 2015, 9:07 PM
George Hughes
Cuz if you do not like it
Jan 5, 2015, 9:07 PM
George Hughes
I like it, but I feel the last line is a little abrupt?? [?]
Jan 5, 2015, 9:06 PM
Callum Davies
it's simpe but fast
Jan 5, 2015, 9:05 PM
Callum Davies

Jan 5, 2015, 9:02 PM

Dec 31, 2014, 12:25 AM
Callum Davies
okay then, see you there
Dec 30, 2014, 4:16 PM
George Hughes
yeah, i'll just go on
Dec 30, 2014, 4:15 PM
Callum Davies
yup, exactly, in fact, do you want to go on skype now, save us typing? are you free?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:15 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, that makes sense, if you want to do something, do it right, eh ;-)
Dec 30, 2014, 4:13 PM
Callum Davies
but we can't go start from writng the script to recordng it, if you wouldn't mind i'd like to spend a bit of time with the script, working out how i'm gunna say my lines, and developing my character. I plan on doing this properly :P
Dec 30, 2014, 4:13 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, that sounds cool!
Dec 30, 2014, 4:12 PM
Callum Davies
sounds like a plan, have a session in the studio! as for the storyline, i could help you with that if you need, we could have a few writing sessions over skype and batter out a script together
Dec 30, 2014, 4:11 PM
George Hughes
I'd probably need a full storyline before I can even begin the programming, and I'll record you with my condenser ;-)
Dec 30, 2014, 4:10 PM
Callum Davies
sounds like fun, would you need input on the script, or would you just write it, send it to me, then i'd record my lines and send the voice files to you?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:09 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, that would be cool, I'm not great at first person or third person but I can work on that
Dec 30, 2014, 4:08 PM
Callum Davies
ohhh, i dunno, you're the genius with the ideas, i'd just be reading from a script recording lines. how about a good old-fashioned zombie game?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:07 PM
George Hughes
Yeah man, that would be awesome! If you've got any ideas for games that would need that, I'd be happy to take a look
Dec 30, 2014, 4:06 PM
Callum Davies
well, i've wanting to get into voice-acting, and that is mainly done in anmation and games, which you do. so, i was thinking, if you ever created a game that needed someone to voice a charcter, i could maybe do it?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:05 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, what's up?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:04 PM
Callum Davies
could you maybe help me out with something?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:04 PM
George Hughes
Cool! And yeah, it was good thanks
Dec 30, 2014, 4:03 PM
Callum Davies
yup, great thanks, yourself?
Dec 30, 2014, 4:03 PM

George Hughes
Okay, no worries
Apr 29, 2014, 6:26 PM
Callum Davies
i've been watching them back and they're a bit racy at times, said some things i didn't want to say, so i'll probably think twice before uploading them
Apr 29, 2014, 4:52 PM
George Hughes
By the way, when are you uploading those silly minecraft videos?
Apr 29, 2014, 2:31 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 18, 2014, 1:13 PM
George Hughes
You can get a behringer delay/echo for around £20 but let me just check...
Apr 18, 2014, 1:12 PM
Callum Davies
well if you think i'm learning too fast i suppose i could slow down a bit! lol. that's a pretty good idea, i've been looking at things for my b'day, i havent really had any ideas yet, so thanks! by the by, how much money are we looking at?
Apr 18, 2014, 1:11 PM
George Hughes
See if you can get a cheap delay pedal cause tapping sounds amazing with delay!
Apr 18, 2014, 1:09 PM
Callum Davies
slow, but nice. i'll practice and eventually get faster so i can sound like Blackmore! :P
Apr 18, 2014, 1:09 PM
George Hughes
Great! How's it sounding then?
Apr 18, 2014, 1:08 PM
Callum Davies
ha ha, that's good news! oh btw, i've been learning how to do guitar tapping
Apr 18, 2014, 1:07 PM
George Hughes
Thanks, so do you, and this video is going to take an hour! Only an hour! Our internet has improved!
Apr 18, 2014, 1:07 PM
Callum Davies

Callum Davies

Apr 18, 2014, 1:02 PM
Callum Davies
maybe i will, thanks for the heads up!
Apr 18, 2014, 1:02 PM
George Hughes
Cool! Have you ever heard of Virtual Dub? It's video editing software and it supports some of the greatest codecs out there! You should look into it.
Apr 18, 2014, 1:01 PM
Callum Davies
54% exported, then after that i'll have to upload it, that will probably be an overnight job
Apr 18, 2014, 1:00 PM
George Hughes
Haha! Best one yet! How's the videos coming along?
Apr 18, 2014, 1:00 PM
Callum Davies
well i suppose you could also chuck it out a plane at 40,000 feet, and have a dell skyfall
Apr 18, 2014, 12:58 PM
Callum Davies

Apr 18, 2014, 12:52 PM
George Hughes
Are you getting any extra support? Apparently next year, Nicol will be sitting all his exams on a laptop!!!
Apr 18, 2014, 12:52 PM
Callum Davies
oh cool
Apr 18, 2014, 12:51 PM
George Hughes

Feb 27, 2014, 10:04 PM
George Hughes
With an acoustic i can do a bit! But rock and roll is really just rock blues
Feb 27, 2014, 10:04 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 27, 2014, 10:03 PM
George Hughes
I can do a wee bit o' jazz and with a bass i can do all kinds o' funky funk rythm!
Feb 27, 2014, 10:03 PM
Callum Davies
oh could you maybe learn a different style of riff. maybe jazz or rock or funk or whatever. give a bit of differnce from blues
Feb 27, 2014, 10:02 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, totally!
Feb 27, 2014, 10:01 PM

Probably Whatsername and Give Me Novocaine both by Green Day
Feb 27, 2014, 9:58 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 27, 2014, 9:58 PM
George Hughes

Feb 27, 2014, 9:57 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 27, 2014, 9:57 PM
George Hughes
Cool! Nope i don't but its gonna be fun! I'll bring my acoustic and do some rockin' tunes!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:56 PM
Callum Davies
what's done is done. if zoe has taught me one thing it's that. you know when your playing the talent show yet?
Feb 27, 2014, 9:55 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, course! Best to not hold grudges!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:54 PM
Callum Davies
yea you probably should. mum told me that mairi phoned to see how i was! made my day. I hope me and zo and you can all stay friends
Feb 27, 2014, 9:54 PM
George Hughes
Yeah, definitely, i have been carrying a lot guitarwise recently so i think i need to give myself a rest
Feb 27, 2014, 9:53 PM
Callum Davies
ohhh! i'm sure it's not permenant for you though. couple days r&r and you'll be good as new, i'm sure!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:52 PM
George Hughes
Haha, I know, Mum says I shouldn't be lifting heavy weights without the string muscle cause that's what caused her permanent back damage when she was younger
Feb 27, 2014, 9:51 PM
Callum Davies
hah, idiot! are you ok? (and yes, it does have to be in that order, it's the law!)
Feb 27, 2014, 9:50 PM
George Hughes
Playing guitar, managed to pull a muscle in my back and give myself a stitch moving chairs at Rock Challenge :-s
Feb 27, 2014, 9:49 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 27, 2014, 9:48 PM
Callum Davies
yea, it'll still be suprise for everyone else though. they think its just me, tell mr kelman not to put it in the bulliten or anything, just pout it down as me
Feb 27, 2014, 9:47 PM
George Hughes
I agree but then it might be classed as unfair so i'll check with Mr Kelman anyway. It will be fun though!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:47 PM
Callum Davies
hah, no! let's keep it a suprise!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:46 PM
George Hughes
Yeah if you want! But i'll need to check with Mr Kelman if i'm allowed to come up twice!

A cloud is a real thing. Its either a network where clients can upload data eg youtube or ICloud or it is a collection of evaporated H20. :-P
Feb 27, 2014, 9:42 PM
Callum Davies
i thought that was the cloud. well you learn something new every day!
Feb 27, 2014, 9:41 PM
George Hughes
The ether is the name for a figurative space where all the internet is stored! It isn't real though.
Feb 27, 2014, 9:40 PM
Callum Davies

Feb 24, 2014, 6:56 PM
George Hughes
Indispensable what?

Feb 24, 2014, 6:53 PM
Callum Davies
hi george
Feb 24, 2014, 6:53 PM
Callum Davies
i could really do with telling her how i feel, could you do me a massive favour and ask her to give me a call after tea?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:57 PM
George Hughes
Bye!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:56 PM
Callum Davies
ok then, bye
Feb 24, 2014, 5:56 PM
George Hughes
I gotta go for tea now so i'll see you later!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:55 PM
Callum Davies
i genuinly think this will take a lot of time, she really hurt me george. but what you gunna do, she's always been the one who wears the trousers
Feb 24, 2014, 5:55 PM
George Hughes
That's being pessimistic again. It won't take long till you feel back to normal/better again
Feb 24, 2014, 5:53 PM
Callum Davies
ohhh, i dunno about a week, a few months minimum i think
Feb 24, 2014, 5:53 PM
George Hughes
I took time with me too but i felt better within a week so i'm sure you'll feel better soon as well!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:52 PM
Callum Davies
better, but not my usual self, thx for helping but i think it will take time to heal this wound for it is deep
Feb 24, 2014, 5:51 PM
George Hughes
That's fine! How are you feeling now then?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:50 PM
Callum Davies
dont need to be now, just whenever is fine
Feb 24, 2014, 5:50 PM
George Hughes
I dunno, i'll see.
Feb 24, 2014, 5:50 PM
Callum Davies
not for you! i remener you said that! i mean for mum dad and zoe
Feb 24, 2014, 5:49 PM
George Hughes
That might be fun to go see a comedian live, i've never been to a live performance! And i said a month or so back that i wasn't really interested in the ceilidh no offense
Feb 24, 2014, 5:49 PM
Callum Davies
tell me if i'm wrong
Feb 24, 2014, 5:48 PM
Callum Davies
a comedian, and we had bought the family tickets for the ceildh on march 8th, but i expect your not going since yesterday
Feb 24, 2014, 5:47 PM
George Hughes
Ceildh. But whose Ross Noble?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:46 PM
Callum Davies
the ceildh or ross noble?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:46 PM
George Hughes
I don't know, is this the thing you were talking about a while back?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:45 PM
Callum Davies
oh incidently, do you know where we stand with the ceildh tickets? also, do you fancy going to see ross noble with me at october?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:44 PM
George Hughes
?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:43 PM
Callum Davies
hello?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:43 PM
George Hughes
Love is a great thing, but as November Rain states: "Nothing lasts forever"
Feb 24, 2014, 5:43 PM
Callum Davies
as barry manilow said: the moral of this story - don't fall in love
Feb 24, 2014, 5:42 PM
Callum Davies
can she not understand my pain though, i mean she seemed pretty upset at the thought of it on thurs, but i dont know neither me nor you are zoe, i wont be ready to love again for a very long time
Feb 24, 2014, 5:42 PM
George Hughes
That's just my input but as I said you're whole life is ahead of you so you will find and give plenty of love and get you're heart broken many more times. As will I!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:40 PM
Callum Davies
maybe, that's what she said. thx, but i dont want pretty girls, i dont want "groupies" i want love, and i'm not sure if im gunna be able to find it again
Feb 24, 2014, 5:39 PM
George Hughes
I don't know, i'm not Zoë. But remember you still have your whole life to lead! You'll meet many a pretty girls and if it's meant to be, you might get back together when you're older!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:38 PM
Callum Davies
well i feel like i have done nothing but give her love attention and support, and she pays me back like this. also, you know what happened on thrusday when she was upset and we broke up, and then she got back together with me because "it didn't feel right being apart". so that would indictae to me that she wants to be with me, so i'm just so confused as to why the sudden change of heart in about a week
Feb 24, 2014, 5:36 PM
George Hughes
You there?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:36 PM
George Hughes
Shoot away :-)
Feb 24, 2014, 5:34 PM
Callum Davies
will do, but first, can i tell you why i feel confused?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:33 PM
George Hughes
Run cold water over them then :-)
Feb 24, 2014, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
oww my knuckles hurt!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:32 PM
George Hughes
Apoligise for it and tell her why you have been angry, sit down for 30 minutes and chat about life and you're mum is the best person to talk to because she will have experience life.
Feb 24, 2014, 5:32 PM
Callum Davies
that's gunna be expensive to fix, mum's gunna kill me!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:30 PM
Callum Davies
ive learnt that communication doesnt work! and i'm not proud of this but i just got so angry i punched a dent in my wall
Feb 24, 2014, 5:30 PM
George Hughes
Complaining won't get you anywhere, if you think negative, negative will occur. If you are having family issues communicate with them and all will be well!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:29 PM
Callum Davies
but what about when nothing goes right, and while dad is in sunderland mum is usually stressed, which means that her and me argue on a near daily basis! you call that loving?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:28 PM
George Hughes
Life is exactly that which is why the only way to go is to look at the good things in it otherwise you will end up depressed.
Feb 24, 2014, 5:27 PM
Callum Davies
listen, right now the last thing i need is your relentless optimism, right now i need care and advice, becuase i have learnt somthing, that the world is unfair and that life is just one long slug of useless events and then you die!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:26 PM
George Hughes
Wow, pessimistic, at least you still have a loving family with two parents! Think how many people at our school don't!
Feb 24, 2014, 5:25 PM
Callum Davies
well it seems fitting that everything i love should disappear
Feb 24, 2014, 5:24 PM
George Hughes
Aww why?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:24 PM
Callum Davies
oh i'm giving up on the comedy as well
Feb 24, 2014, 5:23 PM
George Hughes
Well of course you'd feel a little down but look on the bright side, you could use this experience for something maybe a comedy routine, maybe a poem! It's all a learning experience! :-)
Feb 24, 2014, 5:23 PM
Callum Davies
hello?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:22 PM
Callum Davies
think really hard about it, given what just happened to me, how do you think i would feel?
Feb 24, 2014, 5:21 PM
George Hughes
I can't see you so i'm unable to tell
Feb 24, 2014, 5:21 PM
Callum Davies

May 15, 2013, 8:17 PM
Callum Davies
that's nothing against you, it's just how your mind works
May 15, 2013, 8:16 PM
Callum Davies
oh no i mean why it didnt work on you. it's because you have a very logical brain, you didnt think that you could move the bolt with ur mind, so you created a mental block making it impossible for you to
May 15, 2013, 8:16 PM
George Hughes
Am i right?
May 15, 2013, 8:15 PM
George Hughes
When you think about doing something, your brain automatically makes you do it on a small scale. Ideomotor!

Nov 29, 2012, 5:42 PM

Nov 29, 2012, 5:37 PM
Callum Davies
i'll tell u why, because it's about decency and respect, and that skin is special to me becuase u made it for me, and posting it online robs it of it's value, so please, respect my wishes and take it off
